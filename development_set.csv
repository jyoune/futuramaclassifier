Fry, Fine. Break my heart again.
Bender," Nah, I'm comfy."
Fry, Pizza delivery for Mr. ... ... Seymour Asses.
Leela," You know, this might actually work. The Omicronians seem to have trouble telling one person from another."
Farnsworth," You'll be picking up a monument commemorating my lost crew. To be unveiled Tuesday at their memorial ceremony. All the grieving families will be there. Plus, a popsicle cart!"
Farnsworth," Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas. Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038."
Fry," Huh. I knew you had other crews, but you never told us you had a first crew."
Fry," Oh, now I get it!"
Leela, Yeah! Play those bongos!
Fry," Sorry, but if it's not here in half an hour, it's free."
Fry, Now it's personal.
Fry," And there's a robot scratching post. You should try it out, Bender."
Farnsworth," Zoidberg, no! The effects of jar juice aren't fully understood!"
Farnsworth, Tonight is the ribbon-cutting for the DOOP's new headquarters.
Farnsworth," So, this! If ever the two crystals should meet, their wave functions would collapse like Raymond Burr's trampoline, once again rendering all dark matter inert and useless as fuel."
Bender, Bender must be stopped. I've gone too far. Who does that guy think I am? Come on! We're gonna march all the way to Hollywood and make them stop forcing their filthy me down our throats!
Amy," Wait, what the Shmell happened? I thought Ndnd disintegrated you with this ray gun."
Hermes, You could use it for picnics.
Fry, Even me?
Fry, Yay!
Bender," Wait a minute, you know lots of rock stars, and most of them like to look like they care about things!"
Fry, Every Christmas my mom would get a fresh goose for goose burgers and my dad would whip up his special eggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes. This dumb holiday just makes me think of all the things I left behind. Let's just stop talking about Xmas.
Fry," Well, aren't they?"
Leela, We can't leave yet. We've got to wait for Bender. The high gravity must be slowing down his looting.
Leela," No, Fry! You can't fall fast enough!"
Leela," It's no use. We'd better turn back. Which way, Fry?"
Fry, No.
Zoidberg, Aha! Now the rubber band's on the other claw!
Hermes, We're saved!
Fry, No time! Run! Run to safety!
Bender," Bender, you're a genius!"
Fry," Aw. Thanks, Bender."
Fry, No! Did you see it? Did you see it?
Leela, Stop! Stop eating Popplers!
Hermes," Let's see now, which bait to use? Crickets? Squid? Chicken necks?"
Leela," Dear Fry, our time together was short, but it was the best time of my life."
Farnsworth," Pine trees aren't barking snakes. They won't just turn up in a salad at Olive Garden. But there is one hope, and, as usual, it's Norwegian!"
Farnsworth," Bender, you won't believe this, but the empathy chip burned out. The emotion you felt for Nibbler was actually your own."
Leela, Heirloom eggs?! That's so life-affirming! I'll bet you run your own hatchery. Just you and your wife... Matilda.
Farnsworth," So what?! I'm going to die of hypermalaria, anyway. I was in the same swamp as the rest of the men."
Leela," After all this time, somebody else with one eye who isn't a clumsy carpenter or, uh, a kid with a BB gun."
Bender," Morgan made me walk the Professor. There we were in the park when suddenly some old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked the Professor at her but she kept coming. So I had to hit her with this purse I found. Ah, the point is, it's Morgan's fault. That pencil-pushing scazwag. Why, if she were here, I'd-- Uh-oh, is she behind me?"
Bender, I can move again. My music career is over.
Farnsworth," Ah, the last proton should be decaying about now."
Fry," Bender, you knew all this would happen, didn't you?"
Hermes, We're not your friends! We're your victims!
Bender, Seriously? Why?
Amy," Antidepressants? Well, I certainly don't want to get depressed."
Bender, Leela's right! I don't wanna end up a loser like her. Count me back in!
Bender," Robot gets bored and kills Fry with a hammer! Sorry, go on."
Leela, We haven't thought of a name yet.
Fry," Please, Mr. Nixon. We're appealing to your sense of decency."
Fry, I'm rich! I can live whenever I want.
Leela, Wait. What's that?
Bender, Suck my luck!
Leela, Halfway there. The ship should be getting a bit less rational now.
Farnsworth, I'm sciencing as fast as I can.
Bender, Hey. We're just a stone's throw from Tijuana. See?
Fry," So, where is this egg?"
Bender, Forget it! You can't tempt me.
Bender, Duh!
Fry, Good. Good.
Bender, Mommy!
Fry, Nope!
Bender," And that is why they call me Bender the Magnificent! Hey, where'd everybody go?"
Bender," Just 'cause I can't move my arms and legs,"
Fry, In New York? Bathrooms.
Fry, No kidding.
Bender, Pansy!
Fry, And another thing  You're using an awful lot of make-up there.
Fry," For God's sake, censor it!!! CENSOR IT!!!"
Fry," Come back, Bender! It's working!"
Leela, It is pretty sickening.
Zoidberg, They're tastier than an unguarded penguin nest. What do you call them?
Fry, Please let us live! We'll put out milk and cookies for you!
Amy," You mean, ""along gender lines""?"
Amy, So whatever happened to this seven-leaf clover?
Zoidberg, He looks radiant!
Farnsworth," Ah, Fry, I see you've met Guenter!"
Leela," Really? Y'know, I heard that banking industry regulations are really very simple."
Leela, Wow! Now this is fantastic!
Bender, Or toss me into a trash can...
Amy, Aw! You want your diapey changed?
Hermes," No, we're not going anywhere. I can't abide all this bee-on-bee conflict. It's time to African-Americanize these honeybees. Listen up, bees. It's Kwanzaa, a time of Umoja."
Farnsworth," I was thirsty from the flight! I drank swamp water! Look, Zoidberg. You're a loyal friend."
Fry," Professor, we're all sick of your upbeat attitude."
Zoidberg," Bad news, friends. My shell ran."
Hermes, Move forward. Walk into the light.
Hermes, We should do something!
Bender, Really?
Fry," Oh, dip!"
Leela, Me? Award? Him? Me? Good?
Bender," Whoa, whoa! No one wants to count rocks more than me. But our mission is not complete. Not so long as Robot 1-X torments me with his obvious superiority. Ready the catapult, Sinclair. Aim for their power lines. They're the devil's veins and electricity is his blood."
Fry, Do you think we should?
Bender, I am Bender. Please insert girder.
Bender, I mean three-thousand-eighteen rat kidneys.
Fry, It's a fool proof plan. They can't sign the wedding license if I give them a pen with no ink.
Bender," Hey, sometimes a guy gets lonely."
Leela, Who are you?
Leela, But you have no idea what life forms might be evolving out there.
Leela," Oh, I do."
Zoidberg, Enough already with the banging and the swashbuckling.
Farnsworth, We?
Fry," OK, you can have my nose."
Farnsworth," Shizz, baby. So paradox free time travel is possible after all."
Fry, Maybe later.
Farnsworth, Stand back.
Fry, Not really.
Zoidberg, What's going on? Is this angry yelling or busted-hearing-aid yelling?
Bender," Well, time for this robot to get back to work."
Fry, Anchovies?
Leela," OK, almost got it. Steady. Steady. Don't panic."
Fry, Then I'm goin' in after him.
Amy," We're lucky even to play as guests, Leela. Dad's club has a very strict ""No girls allowed"" policy."
Bender," Hush, little brewski, Don't you leak, Daddy wants to drink for at least a week."
Hermes," Line up, people! Everyone take a shovel and one sixth of the planet. We'll meet back here in 50 years, our bodies broken and our lives wasted."
Leela," So, your real name is Lord Nibbler? That's a coincidence."
Fry," I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded out."
Fry," Um, I don't mean to be rude, but it's kind of hard to take you seriously when you say junk like ""grok"" and ""junk."""
Fry, What'd they die of?
Fry, Indeed so. Most indeededly.
Amy," Well, that probably won't happen this time."
Hermes, You rotten kids!
Bender," Yes, Moon pa?"
Bender," What the heck, I'll treat myself."
Bender, I'll get you fixed up. That's fine.
Fry," Look, up ahead."
Fry, I'll take a small Slurm.
Amy," Thanks for saving my life, Kif. You're my hero."
Leela, Are not!
Leela, I'm coming in after you!
Bender," My fellow leaguie-weegies, the time has come to overthrow humanity!"
Bender, The Maltese Liquor?! The strongest and most valuable malt liquor ever brewed! And soon it will be mine... I'm sorry. You were sayin'?
Bender, I can't believe it! I'm gonna die.
Fry, Yay!
Fry," Uh... Heroes don't do drugs! Except for Drugman, I guess."
Hermes, That's my boy!
Bender, I miss Nibbler.
Fry," Well, you never know unless you try. Like, I didn't know if I could swallow a softball, so I gave it my best shot and voil√†! Wait, that's not it. Ah, thar she blows!"
Leela," It's you and me, ponytail."
Farnsworth, I don't want to go through that! I want you to kill me!
Leela, We better whisper.
Leela," Hello, Awesome Express; the rude, crude delivery dudes. How may I direct your call? What's that? You haven't gotten your paper? In how long?"
Fry," Yo, yo, Bezender! What up?"
Bender, I prefer two. That way we can still be a horse for Hallowe'en!
Bender, Catering.
Bender, There's your problem. The Professor put the counter on upside-down.
Zoidberg, She also took home two rolls of Scotch tape.
Fry, You jerk. I thought I was your best friend. What kind of two-timing kill-mobile are you?
Fry," How much time does he have left, Professor?"
Fry, She had to have four other boyfriends! I guess she never thought I'd become tentacle pope of the world!
Leela, He seemed nice.
Bender," Whoa-oh, yeah!"
Bender, Two.
Fry, Whoa!
Fry, Who's the perp?
Leela, I do love a man in uniform. I mean a uniform that doesn't involve short pants.
Fry, What's happening? Space cow?
Bender, I'm not allowed to vote.
Amy, I knew you wanted a son! Why do you think I became a miniature golf champion? Why do you think I wear these stupid boys' sweat suits?
Fry, Space. It seems to go on and on forever. But then you get to the end and the gorilla starts throwing barrels at you.
Fry," Uh, hello, Mrs. Mellonger."
Hermes, Life. Death. Either way I'm demoted to a tiny cubicle.
Leela, Bird's don't crawl.
Hermes, It's a bird!
Bender," What's the matter, Fry, you scared? Or just crazy?"
Farnsworth," Defeat is ours. If we can't communicate with these bone-jelly ghosts, we're doomed!"
Fry, You have the most beautiful eyes I think I...
Farnsworth, You mean you don't remember?
Fry," Now that he's gone, I realise how valuable a Robot life can be... When it belongs to my best friend."
Fry, You think they'd let me use it to look for Bender?
Fry, There's just something I have to find out.
Fry, And we can tie these caterpillars together to make bow strings for bows and arrows.
Fry, But won't that crush my bones?
Hermes, Rage dump!
Bender, Ooooooh!
Fry, I'd like the 2003 model.
Bender, Hey! That's my brain!
Fry, So what do you nerds want?
Fry, Why do they call it that?
Leela," I know you spent a lot of money on this place, Fry, but it's awfully primitive. The floors are made of such hard wood."
Hermes," Mon, it must take forever to brand all those cattle."
Hermes, It's nobody. Now sign that will I gave you! He's not here.
Bender, Eat it or beat it.
Farnsworth," Wait a moment. If we could scavenge the right parts from these robo-dinos, I might be able to construct a rudimentary spaceship to get us off this planet!"
Fry, Aha! You can't escape it!
Farnsworth, My life is over.
Fry," Oh, no! The gorilla! That's a par-four!"
Fry, So let's keeping going forward.
Hermes," Stick to someone else, you windy barnacle!"
Farnsworth, You can't suddenly know something just by assembling a committee of words. That's it. I'll assemble your committee!
Fry, Ih.
Zoidberg, The President is gagging on my gas bladder! What an honour!
Fry," It was just a dream, Bender. There's no such thing as two."
Fry," Well, that's eight hours."
Fry," Oh, God, I'm gonna lose the bet!  I'm gonna have to swim in the juice of the puke-me-poop-yu!"
Zoidberg, So what's the problem? Just get down on your claws and do the apology dance.
Leela, Since when are you my agent?
Bender, Is this seat taken?
Fry," Where are we? Also, when are we?"
Hermes, It's getting cold and smelly. My odor-eaters(?) are going critical.
Bender," Well, no point letting her go to waste."
Fry, Mutants? That's the kind of thing you are.
Hermes, No need to thank us. Your shocked stares of gratitude say it all.
Hermes, Ya can't do that!
Bender, Oh.
Bender, Then I guess you learned a valuable lesson  Don't mess with Earth.
Fry," Sorry, I'm late."
Fry," Finally, a happy ending."
Leela," But it's so round, so hideously round."
Farnsworth, That a girl! If they don't take him back we can keep him as captain.
Fry," I'm sorry, Bender, but there's just not enough room."
Zoidberg, One ship is left only.
Bender," The secret was scratching really, really hard!"
Fry, You mean peer pressure?
Bender," No, next to that. A half-eaten employee directory. Inspector 5's home address. His ass-ias is gracias!"
Bender," Uh, hey, I'm no square but isn't that counter-indicated by my operations manual?"
Bender," Hey, chumps and chumpettes. Did you get the bomb out? Can I go back to saying the word I love to say?"
Bender," Bandidos, eh? Aw, this is great! 'Cause I happen to have a flawless Spanish accent! I will see. Adios Padre! Come, Jesus, my faithful ... chee-huey-hua. Tonight we eat ... gee-wack-a-mole by the El Rio!"
Amy," Bender, part of being human is having self control."
Farnsworth," Now be careful, Fry. And if you kill anyone, make sure to eat their heart, to gain their courage. Their rich, tasty courage."
Zoidberg, Eh!
Hermes," Kudos, Bender. You got mangled and now you're a singer. Both our dreams came true."
Fry," Well, the doctor says I'm as healthy as a crab. Can I go into space now?"
Fry, Whoa! Check out that guy. He makes Speedy Gonzales look like Regular Gonzales!
Amy, Yeah!
Bender, I hacked myself inside-out and now the entire universe is my processor.
Fry," Yes, please!"
Fry, What are you talking about? There's all kinds of robots down there.
Zoidberg," You can't hunt a Yeti by yourself, sir. It's suicidal."
Bender," I know it hurts, buddy. But at least you're not in a sick relationship with a robot anymore."
Bender," All in! I mean, fold. Whatever."
Farnsworth," Good God. Just knowing we're in the same genus makes me embarrassed to call myself homo. Now, get out and tell Mom thanks for the crystal."
Bender," Hey, wait a second. I've got the perfect solution."
Farnsworth, Ten...
Fry, We don't work for you anymore!
Hermes, I'm afraid it's both.
Fry, Hmm?
Bender, Whoa! What a cheesy effect!
Bender," No, I think I may have hurt someone. Oh, Lord! I'm on the verge of a nervous meltdown."
Farnsworth," Go, Johnny! Go! That's an order!"
Zoidberg, Why?
Hermes," It's the biggest Jamaican platter I've ever seen. Jerk chicken, jerk beef, jerk pork. Is there any meat this man can't jerk?"
Bender, I'm Bender. You know? The lovable rascal.
Farnsworth," Listen up, Hollywood. We're an exciting, new mob."
Bender, You could drop dead. That'd show 'em.
Zoidberg, My head is spinning.
Leela," Nice ass, ass."
Leela, It is very nice. I just wish Amy and I didn't have to wear these sexist badges on our melons.
Bender," Uh-oh, jealousy. You think you're so hot!"
Leela, So what happened to Project Satan?
Leela, You took this from Fry's locker?
Fry, What?
Bender, Um...
Fry," Never mind, Professor. She came to."
Fry, We're rescuing you.
Fry," Well, at least I learned Leela's a lost cause. I give up."
Bender, Alright!
Zoidberg," Excuse me, I believe I'm the doctor."
Zoidberg, Stop!
Fry, Oh. Oh!
Fry, Voices always yelling. Who - who said that? I'm not insane. Stop it. Stop talking in me!
Fry, Admit it! You're disgusted by me!
Bender," Ah, what the heck?"
Hermes, Dr. Zoidberg brought us.
Fry, You too? Will you be my friend?
Leela," Come on, Fry! Die with dignity!"
Leela, Creeped out.
Farnsworth," Think, Zoidberg. You must remember something!"
Fry, No wonder you've been staying at the back of conga lines lately.
Fry, Hey! Now what am I supposed to watch and drink all day?
Farnsworth," Oh, please! That's preposterous science-fiction mumbo-jumbo. Guenter's intelligence actually lies in his electronium hat which harnesses the power of sunspots to produce cognitive radiation."
Farnsworth," No refunds! Shut up and bow your heads! Oh, mighty Isis‚Äî"
Leela," Me, neither. Now, Sex and the City, that's funny."
Bender," It's gonna be fun on a bun, in space."
Bender," Lookin' good, meatball!"
Fry, But she'll crush you like a worm ... crushing a smaller worm.
Fry," Well, it turns out I loved her, but I wasn't in love with her."
Fry, I dunno. Fry?
Leela," I'm here and I'm getting along just fine, thank you. My walk to work today just took a little longer than usual. Nibbler took me through the zoo for some reason."
Bender," I dunno. Let me see. Oh, my God, you're Beck! I'd get up to shake your hand and steal your wallet but my crappy body crapped out on me."
Fry, Ow!
Fry," Thanks, doll."
Amy, That's odd. This hand here doesn't belong to anybody. And it's pointing a knife at James the Lesser!
Farnsworth," Go on, you dummy."
Amy, Look out! It's pulling us through a field of spacebergs!
Leela," No! Nibbler, come back!"
Farnsworth," Now I'm sick! I shudder to think what this cold will do to me. Yesterday, I was nearly killed by a tight hat!"
Fry, My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna die.
Fry," We'll never find that disk will we, Bender?"
Bender," Listen up, 'cause I've got a climactic speech! You, cameraman, keep the camera rolling. You, director, gimmie my motivation."
Leela," You've changed, Fry."
Leela," Uh, Professor--"
Fry, That's the plan.
Bender, I believe that qualifies as ill. At least from a technical standpoint.
Amy," Bender, you're famous!"
Leela, Mom! Dad!
Fry," Alright, diamond. You won those rounds. But I've got an ace up my hole."
Fry, Okay.
Fry," Look, Leela, I'm sorry. I never should have dragged you out here."
Leela," Oh, sorry."
Zoidberg, Or one!
Leela, Especially from everybody.
Leela, It's not fair. I just hope that dumb chicken is ashamed of himself.
Bender," Silence, you cur! Puff out that brisket!"
Bender, I accept your challenge.
Farnsworth, The problem with both parties is that they always want to give your tax dollars to the less fortunate.
Fry, Come on!
Amy, Call me.
Farnsworth," I know you're all very upset, especially Bender."
Amy," Crappin' A! Still, I'm sure the women are having an even harder time."
Leela, Whoa. Maybe you're right. I only meant to slap you twice.
Fry, It's nice! But there's still somethin' I don't like about that guy. My dad always said you could tell a lot about a man by the rigidity of 'is shins.
Fry," That's the same reason they kept me out of school. So, no one even cared that I was gone?"
Fry, My God! It's full of ads!
Fry," Yes there is, Bender. Bender was a lot of things to a lot of people. But, looking back, the number one thing I can say about him is this, and simply this  Bender was my friend."
Bender, A what kind of disturbance?
Bender," You honour me, Chairman Koji."
Bender, Faster!
Zoidberg, Deviled egg?
Fry, Morgan? It's 3am.
Fry, Bender? Bender?
Amy," Oh, Kif, it's so romantic I can't even wait! I'm gonna wear it right now."
Leela," You can't have whiplash, you don't have a neck."
Hermes, Sweet giant anteater of Saint Anita! The Professor's been eaten by giant anteaters!
Bender, Um ... uh...
Bender," Hey, let me try. Whoa! That gives me a headache."
Fry," Amy, are those gear imprints on your sweatpants?"
Farnsworth, Exactly! It's none of our concern.
Bender, Set a course for adventure!
Fry," It's an ale! Five gallons, six ounces!"
Farnsworth," Miss McNeal, I'm afraid I must decline your offer of marriage. For, you see, I'm dying. Cough, then fall over dead."
Bender," Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty grog. Arr! The laws o' science be a harsh mistress!"
Leela, Bender! Romance isn't about money.
Leela," Fry, that's so sweet. Let me see."
Fry," Yes, please."
Bender," And even though the computer was off and unplugged, an image stayed on the screen. It was ... the Windows logo!"
Farnsworth," Bad news, everyone! Look at this infinite series representing the mass of successive generations of Benders."
Fry," No. No! Oh, my God! It's Pauly Shore!"
Farnsworth," This explains everything! Even the Big Bang that created the universe! All that's left is the mathematics! Put down h-bar, uh, carry the infinity, and‚Äî My-reka! There it is! The Grand Unified Theory! Reducing all the laws of nature to a single equation!"
Bender," Sorry you struck out, sausage link."
Bender," Suicide booths! Well, Fry, it was a pleasure meeting you. I'm gonna go kill myself."
Farnsworth," Sounds great, Hermes! Whatever you say. Let's ditch him and go to the movies!"
Bender, Hang on a second Fry. I don't remember you being that ugly.
Fry, Ew!
Fry," Zoidberg, a diplomat? The list of things I've heard now contains everything."
Hermes," That's a plus sign, you pointy-haired loony! Quit thinking you're a robot!"
Amy," Oh, no!"
Fry, Smells like strawberries.
Bender," Oh, jeez! I went to high school with that guy!"
Bender, Never!
Bender," Shut up, Zoidberg. He's right, Leela."
Fry," Happy birthday, Leela. I'm really sorry I'm gonna be one minute late, because we are testing the professor's dumb time machine. But you know, happy birthday and all and... ... I love you. My card!"
Fry, He's made of candy.
Fry, Melllvar's got a spaceship!
Zoidberg, How do I look?
Bender," Wow! I'm finally gonna see my favourite chef, TV's Elzar. Oh this is the greatest nanosecond of my life. No, this one is-- No, this one. Wait ... that one was slightly worse. Ah, so far, so good on this one."
Bender," I've had it up to here with this place. I'm off to the Head Museum to hang out with classy heads like me who appreciate the finer things  poetry, philosophy, hats. So long, coffin stuffers! Uh, could one of you coffin stuffers please carry me?"
Leela, What happened to the buggalo?
Leela," You see, beneath my obsession lay an even deeper obsession. An obsession so strong, it allowed me to overpower the beast's will and pilot it through space and time. An obsession... With completing my delivery!"
Leela, She doesn't need an operation! She's fine the way she is!
Hermes," Oh, that's big!"
Zoidberg, No.
Fry, Nooo! Are you people satisfied? This gentle visitor is dying! And we'll never even know why he came.
Leela," Let's go, you murderer! Fry, help me lock 'im up!"
Farnsworth, They haven't aged a day! The whale must have some kind of M√∂bius colon that endlessly recycles time and space!
Leela, You really don't want me to be captain anymore?
Farnsworth, I was out fleeing some robots and the silvery moonlight glinting off their bloody claws made me think of you.
Bender, To the beat y'all! To the beat y'all! I'm dancin' a jig wid ma feets y'all!
Fry, I'm not prejudiced.
Bender," Now, if you'll excuse me. I'm off to slay the werewolf of Goblin Mountain."
Bender, Guys! Guys! You're never gonna believe this!
Fry," Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, what's that jazz on your head?"
Farnsworth, Horray denied! Need I remind you that robosexual marriage is illegal!
Fry," Hear, hear!"
Leela," Maybe we should wait till afterwards, in case neither of us comes back."
Amy, Uh-huh.
Leela," Hey, why weren't you Kong donkeys outside cleaning up?"
Bender, Here's your chequebook.
Fry, This is gonna be a cakewalk!
Fry, That's not the wheel.
Hermes," Oh, this is great!"
Leela," Come on, Fry, don't be scared, I'm sure at least one of us will be spared, So just sit back, enjoy the ride."
Hermes, Oh!
Farnsworth, Diamondillium it is.
Leela," Actually, you're on time."
Fry," I've never seen a supernova blow up, but if it's anything like my old Chevy Nova, it'll light up the night sky!"
Fry, So?
Farnsworth," Leela, have you seen the keys to the spaceship?"
Fry, Nah. I read in Newsweek that she drinks human blood.
Leela, Face it Fry. Baseball was as boring as mum and apple pie. That's why they jazzed it up.
Bender, Can we have some money?
Farnsworth, Shut up! I was gonna say that!
Farnsworth," Gadzooks! Bender's hard drive no longer contains any of his old memories. When the Feds bumpkinised him, they completely wiped out his old identity!"
Zoidberg, The three coworkers I liked... all dead!
Fry, I'm as mad as I've ever been.
Bender, I'm dying. I need mouth to ass resuscitation.
Fry," Pine needles. Oh, man, this is great! Hey, as long as you don't make me smell Uranus."
Bender," 200,001?"
Farnsworth," Just slow it down, I'll shoot Hitler out the window. Darn! I hit Eleanor Roosevelt by mistake. Okay. Nearing our era again. Here we go. Careful this time. Careful."
Fry, That was a mistake.
Amy, Of course! And it only breaches into our 3-D universe to hunt and fill its lungs with vacuum!
Farnsworth, They're not fans.
Fry," Let my people stay! [He shoots a beam of energy at the wave of sewage, parting it."
Bender," That's the world's greatest robot artist, Vincent van Gobot. He was built without an ear, but then he went crazy and had one installed."
Bender," Bam yourself! Hey, who are they?"
Bender, V√°monos!
Fry, Isn't that the same machine that makes noses?
Amy, Gross!
Hermes," Come on, woman! Just pick something."
Bender, Let's commence preparations for rumbling!
Fry, But who could possibly bend such a huge pipe?
Fry, Why?
Hermes, Uh ... no.
Amy," Hey, that's me!"
Leela, We're here. I followed the bouncing balls. I'll keep the chopper at a safe altitude while you parachute down.
Bender," Eh, he's gone. He said you should keep wasting your life though."
Amy," Fry, I can't believe you're working with my dad against Leela. How can you claim to be her friend and still want her in jail?"
Fry, Since when have you been in the biz?
Fry, Wait! Listen. I'm usually the first guy to toot my own lower horn--
Fry," Run, Leela! They're bouncing right at us!"
Bender, Nobody knows!
Fry," Yeah, ever since I was six."
Farnsworth," Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain."
Bender," Uh-oh, nerds!"
Fry, What's that?
Farnsworth, OK.
Fry, Here it is. The Breakfast Club soundtrack.
Hermes, And here's something. Uh-oh. It's another one of Fry's dogs.
Bender," Aw, hang in there, folks. I'll bet before you know it, you guys'll be-- That is so wrong. They can't just melt down broken robots. Not right when they're kissing my ass."
Leela, Impressive! But it does sorta support my you-are-dead theory.
Fry, Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Leela, Wait .. I ..
Farnsworth, Blimey. I've never felt so ashamed to be a Farnsworth.
Farnsworth," Do you realise what this means, Fry?! Your pet's not dangerous after all!"
Leela, Wait! I want you to look me in the eye and promise you won't get behind the wheel without some kind of alcoholic beverage in your hand.
Bender, I'm a big robot and I want a big cereal!
Amy, Guk! I hate subtitles. Alien films are so pretentious.
Leela," I'm sorry, Bender. What do you want me to put on the glass? Okay, if we survive."
Bender, I like him better this way.
Farnsworth, You're that Bubblegum Tate?
Amy, Fry!
Leela," Nibbler, you... You can talk?"
Fry," Oh, right, cool. C'mon in, roomie! What the--?"
Fry, How do we do that?
Leela," It's because I haven't been exercising.  If only this tree hadn't fallen on me by chance.  Oh, dear God!"
Bender," Sure do, I'm in the magical land of Cornwood, frolicking with wenches."
Leela, My God! Even the Professor's been bent.
Fry, OK.
Leela," Uh, Professor, are we even allowed in the Forbidden Zone?"
Fry," That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, you drive."
Fry, I wanna go to that museum!
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Today you'll be delivering a crate of subpoenas to Sicily 8, the Mob Planet!"
Leela, Wait. Didn't you say Mom keeps the robot control in her bra?
Zoidberg, Amy?
Fry," Hey, Project Satan! Over here! I'm a blind pedestrian! 20 points!"
Amy, So what do you think of that guy by the bar?
Bender," Shut up, baby, I know it!"
Fry," The side that kicks your twisted, metal ass!"
Leela," Dad, you drink? No. Not even then."
Fry, But how can I stop it stop me stop him?
Bender, A-gurgle bufwoozle didoodi houdini.
Fry, Don't tell me how to spend my money.
Zoidberg, Father-Man away.
Fry, What do we do? Should we go for it?
Hermes," No, boy, stop! It's too low! Your backbone can't take it!"
Leela," Oh, Adlai, this is the most beautiful moment of my life!"
Fry, Like Fry! Like Fry!
Bender," This time, you'll have all the human comfort. We'll get a couple of toilets, some food cookers, maybe a puppy."
Bender," Those are waves, jackass. It's supposed to be a river!"
Leela," I know it's not what you want to hear, but I think this is a mistake."
Fry, You're right. Let's do this now and let's never regret it.
Leela," You didn't need to buy me a present, Fry."
Fry," Oh, no! Any sign of Leela or Amy?"
Leela," On the other hand, the stupid fish did eat us. You guys wanna do this?"
Fry," I beg you, Mrs. Astor, if you truly want to honor your husband's memory, treat these people with dignity, as he did."
Fry, Maybe we can figure it out.
Amy," Way to go, Professor. The plan worked."
Fry," Look  I just 'ave a common cold! It'll be gone as fast as I can sneeze, hurl, and squirt it out."
Zoidberg," Forgive me, my friend."
Leela," Sometimes a captain needs to do those things. Besides I, I thought we were friends."
Farnsworth, Okay. I'll just nudge us forward exactly one minute into the‚Äî
Bender, You suck!
Fry," Yes! He chose me! He's trying to kill me! Leela, I'm so happy! Oh, thanks, Bender. Too tight! Too tight!"
Leela," Alright, here's the plan  Zoidberg, pick up the pieces. Everyone else, take five."
Bender, Cheese it!
Bender, As usual! Run away!
Hermes," That thing doesn't have emotions, Fry. Its brain is the size of a walnut."
Leela, What are you doing?
Hermes," Shouldn't you get that, Professor?"
Bender," Maybe I did, Fry. Maybe I did. Or maybe I rescued one last mini-Bender to fold stupid, ugly sweaters while I laughed at him. I guess we'll never know."
Amy, Ow!
Farnsworth, I watched the skies for weeks. With only occasional breaks to tender my grief diarrhea.
Farnsworth," If we fly into it, it could take us trillions of light years away. There's no knowing if we'll ever return."
Fry, I sure do! That's the real robber and I'll never forget his name as long as I live. And that name is--
Leela, Done.
Fry, Yay!
Fry, Yeah!
Hermes," I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day."
Bender," Sir, I volunteer for a suicide mission. Aw, cut it out!"
Farnsworth," There's just one, small problem, and it's a big one. I hid the crystal and I can't remember where."
Fry, Don't worry about it.
Fry, Einstein is a hard name to remember.. Ow!
Amy," Are you doing alright over there, Leela?"
Bender, Lose the Celine Dion tickets and you got yourself a deal.
Leela," Alright, enough of this. There's the atom!"
Bender, Wait! I know you. You're the sleazebag who owns the Ultimate Robot Fighting League.
Fry," Look, the food isn't what's important."
Fry, Let's dump it up!
Zoidberg, Stop! You don't understand!
Bender, I'll need accomplices. A sexy vamp to distract and tie up the guard.
Hermes, Yes!
Amy, Do you mind if we sleep with you?
Amy, Come on! Let's go check on 'im!
Bender," Shut up, doofy. I'm rescuing you."
Fry, I love these things!
Hermes," I think we've all learned a thing or two about sexual stereotypes. While my head's slowly dying 'cause I'm not in a jar yet, you bimbo!"
Zoidberg, A very big kid.
Leela, But it's set 800 years in the past!
Farnsworth, What a fool I was. If only I had made the effort to develop a cleaner-burning robot. But I was tired and in love.
Fry, Sure. That's the kinda sap I like.
Leela," Mom! Dad! Oh, I'm so sorry I got you kidnapped by a crazy madman who tried to feed you to piranhas."
Fry, No!
Fry, I watch TV. It's the next best thing to bein' alive.
Fry," Alright, here's the plan--"
Bender," The pie is ready. You guys like swarms of things, right?"
Fry, That's Leela!
Bender," Oy, this guy."
Leela, What are you doing there?
Fry, Alright. I give up. I guess I'll just go home and marry a skunk.
Fry," Thirty days hath September, April, June and ... wonder ... is that peanut butter ... what am I gonna do? Oh, God! What? What? What is it now?"
Bender, Faster! Faster.
Leela, Who are you?
Leela, Dark matter oil? What if we hit something? The tanker could leak.
Fry," It's my invention, we do it my way! Now all we need is something to pull it and we're set!"
Fry, Woohoohoohoo... ... cares? I'm having dinner with Leela.
Leela, Why can't you accept his help?
Leela," Leela Leela.  I've been thinking, Fry, if I lost you, I don't think I could stand it, either.  I'd probably build a copy of you, too. As long as Robo-Leela's not a jealous type like me, thing will wor‚Äî"
Bender," You forget, Leela, I'm Bender, owner of disguise."
Farnsworth," Uh ... ... Jenny McNeal, you are charged with jury-tampering in last week's case ... ... on account of your hot, naked affair with the foreman. How do you plead?"
Fry, Mr. Peppy?! Bullets make you talk?!
Bender, It's so big and empty.
Bender, I don't feel good. I'm genuinely sick.
Leela," Leeches may not be cuddly like pandas or tribbles, but these poor endangered creatures deserve..."
Leela, I'm taking the ship to my quiet place so I can be alone. You non-creatives can catch a bus home.
Bender, Yabba dabba doo.
Fry, Okay. Here goes.
Amy, 'Cause I was really hoping we could talk and stuff.
Hermes," Likewise. Really, what are we missing out on by not having sex right now?"
Fry," Am I? Am I? Face it, I'm a prize catch. I mean, I'm pulling down delivery boy money."
Leela, How exactly will this protect us from time jumps?
Farnsworth, We can't take that chance! We'll need my universal auto-translator!
Hermes, No one sees the mighty Professor.
Fry," Oh, Lucy! You're just like I always thought you'd be from your movies."
Fry," This is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna live without a body?"
Bender," 9, 10 a big fat hen. The name's Bender!"
Bender," Fry, the title of captain may inflate the human ego, but it's beneath the notice of my mighty robo-logic. Now look spry, men! We launch at six bells!"
Fry," Jeez, doesn't that shock collar hurt?"
Bender, Bender. Have you seen my body? I think the Professor's in it.
Fry, I can't stand this!
Fry, And that's how you play the game!
Fry, It hurts!
Farnsworth," What the hell have you done, Fry?"
Amy," Oh, that's so emotional!"
Bender," That I, Bender, am perfect for the role!"
Fry," Well, usually on the show someone would come up with a complicated plan then explain it with a simple analogy."
Fry, Ow!
Hermes, Did someone say Limbo?
Fry, My soul mate is gone. Why should I go on living?
Fry, Discover card?
Fry, Flexo outranks me?
Fry, You do?
Hermes, To our favourite shows!
Leela, Miller's on a pace to hit 70 blerns!
Bender, One hundred dollars.
Bender," OK, kids, grown-ups gotta talk now, time for bed."
Bender," No! Not the magnets! Swing low, sweet chariot, coming for to carry me home. Swing low, sweet..."
Amy," Kif, don't cry, or you'll get a tummy ache."
Bender," -Good comeback, Leela."
Amy, Those were toenail clippings.
Leela," Well, I could use a new tank top."
Bender, There must be petroleum oil down here somewhere. Go deeper! Deeper!
Leela, The violet dwarf star!
Amy, I guess not. That never occurred to me.
Farnsworth," No, I just said that for Fry's benefit. May the poor fellow feel better about his pointless job."
Bender, Hey? What? No.
Fry, Who cares what you're programmed for. If someone programmed you to jump off a bridge would you do it?
Bender, Alright!
Bender, It's gonna be fun on the bun!
Zoidberg, Oh!
Amy," Leela, those eyes look so great on you."
Fry, Not at all. It's just another thing that makes you a very special lady.
Zoidberg," Argh! You said you wanted me to kill you! Is this one o' those ""No means yes"" deals?!"
Amy," Aw, come on, Leela. Deep down all girls wanna be Miss Universe."
Fry, Eh?
Zoidberg," To induce vomiting, that was the solution. Everywhere it went! What a Valentine's Day that was!"
Zoidberg, You're projecting an air of something.
Bender, Yep. That's exactly the lie we used to get past your guards.
Leela," Oh! You're the chef, are you? Then why don't you make us something nice to eat?"
Bender, Screw that! I ain't no delivery boy! I'm the company's chef.
Amy, Any calls while I was out?
Bender," Every other couple has the right to marry, robot and fembot,"
Fry, Wait! In my time we had a way of moving things long distances without hovering.
Leela," I know. Sometimes, when I'm lonely, I look up at the sky and I get this feeling that somewhere, on some unknown planet, circling a distant star, my parents are up there, looking down on me."
Zoidberg," So, anyway, I hope the men 'ave been taking their hypermalaria pills."
Fry," Well, ma'am, I--"
Bender," Aw, jeez, would you stifle there, meatbag?"
Fry, He's dead.
Hermes," What's the trouble, men? Need some penny rolls for your profits?"
Fry," Finally, the atom is safe."
Leela," Ah, here we are. The worst player in history. If I can be just a little better than him I can slink away with my head held high."
Bender," OK, now I'm mad!"
Amy, I don't think you have anything to worry about. These people seem really mild-mannered.
Bender," Take us home, Bender! Don't worry!"
Fry," Stop, Zoidberg! You'll hurt Francis!"
Leela," No, he couldn't. When you turn 160, robots from the Sunset Squad take you to a mysterious planet and you never return."
Farnsworth," But Boston's 300 miles away and Bender kicked our horse to death! We'll never get there in time! Unless you have another ""invention"" up your sleeve! Foh!"
Farnsworth, This may hurt a little.
Leela," Oh, that's so kind of you. I guess I made a difference after all."
Fry," C'mon, Bender, let's go. This chick-flick is getting me all barfy."
Bender, Aha!
Fry, Ow!
Bender," It's all my fault. Malachi, tell thy people that the Lord is moved by their plight."
Zoidberg, Is bread free?
Fry," Believe it or not, I have more important things to do today than laugh and clap my hands. Reschedule."
Hermes," At least a monster has a body. What I wouldn't give for Wolfman's torso, or any of the groovy ghoulies."
Bender, Louder and sadder.
Leela," Professor, what's the matter."
Leela," No, no! Don't say that! This is real!"
Farnsworth," I understand the problem of age, but suppose I could put you into a new body?"
Leela, Now we just combine them all into one big Parade Day parade and get it over with.
Fry, How do we sign?
Bender," Madam, I believe you're mistaken!"
Fry, I'm Santa Claus!
Amy," Attention, passengers. Please remain seated until the plane comes to a complete crash."
Bender," Yeah, right!"
Leela, Yes! Now we're inflicting.
Leela, Those things are all from the 19th century.
Bender," Down here. I'm so sorry, guys. I never meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything you ever believed in."
Hermes," Woman! No! Ohh, who am I kiddin'? Without my body, I'm a nobody."
Leela, Those poor 20th century women.
Zoidberg, No! Zoidberg's brother is dead! Funny story  I just reverted to the age where my siblings budded from me and my brother Norman split off and jumped in the fountain.
Leela, Half-bottle.
Amy," Uh, maybe. So what?"
Bender," Uh, I'd rather plan some felonies."
Fry, I had more but you go ahead.
Bender," Obviously not, or I'd be strangling you right now."
Amy," Wow, there's a spa in the nut house?"
Fry," My God! He's gonna do it! Everybody, seatbelts to maximum buckling."
Bender, Of course.
Farnsworth," Back in those days, dark matter was just a worthless inert curiosity, and I was smashing it in a particle accelerator, in an ill-conceived attempt to create a more durable harpsichord wax. But, as Deepak Chopra taught us, quantum physics means anything can happen at any time for no reason. Also, eat plenty of oatmeal and animals never had a war. Who's the real animals? And thus against all probabilities... it happened. [The dark matter particles in the particle accelerator begin colliding and exploding. A large explosion leaves only a single item - the single non-local metaparticle crystal."
Fry," Voila. The greatest sandcastle ever built. This is the kind of castle King Arthur would have lived in, if he were a fiddler crab."
Bender," Whoa! The Maltese Liquor! Forty ounces of Heaven! Here, boy. This is for you. Ah! Invisible safe, eh? Aw, yeah, baby. Two-hundred-and-ten proof."
Bender, Another job well done.
Zoidberg," There was one, but now there's two."
Leela," I know, and it's working. But think how much skating would mean to those kids."
Fry," Hey, Alcazar, you left somebody off the guest list."
Fry, What? No!
Bender," I am, your Honor."
Zoidberg, We're not from around here. Hello!
Leela," No, they don't."
Bender," Come on, everyone! Big party in Robot House!"
Farnsworth, All modern robots descend from my original smog-blasting designs. And that's the cause of global warming today.
Fry, Our what?
Hermes, Sweet dodo of Lesotho! Don't you ever stop to think before you speak?
Bender, My dumping business is booming. I just got hired to clean up the set of Free Willy 3.
Bender, I think I'm gonna cry 'Cause it's an extra happy Xmas this year!
Zoidberg," You're a nice man, Nixon."
Amy," Don't be upset, Leela. You, um ... you look really cute in your uniform."
Bender, We could sing.
Leela, Yes! The system works!
Amy," Oh, Kif!"
Zoidberg," Casual hello. It's me, Zoidberg. Act naturally. Ow! Ouch! Get off of me! Stop!"
Fry, How did I do it? How did I get Leela to love me? I've got to figure it out.
Leela," Fry, look around. It's just a crummy plastic flag and a dead man's tracks in the dust. Now get in here before you freeze."
Fry, Will you guys shut up! I'm trying to look cool.
Leela," Ow, ow, ow, ow! My eye!"
Fry," I know. An', as much as I love Mr. Peppy, I love Leela more. He has to be... Put down."
Bender, Ah!
Fry," Let's go, already!"
Farnsworth, Quick! The armour-plated chimney cover! Push! Push!
Fry, Wow!
Fry," Bender, no! You'll make God cry."
Leela, Only without the tuba.
Farnsworth," Wot's more, couldn't go back even if we wonted to.  No more crystalline opal left in all the world, don't you know."
Fry, 50 bucks? Not even if she was my girlfriend. You take her.
Bender, And no one suspects a thing! Whoa! And that's how we learned our lesson!
Bender," C'mon, Fry. Get up!"
Leela," I'm afraid you're both out of your league, boys, 'cause you're looking at a woman who owns her own harpoon."
Fry, He's trapped!
Fry," Wow! I love you guys! Back in the 20th century, I had all five of your albums."
Farnsworth, I suppose.
Leela, I love the tentacle.
Leela, How about zero?
Bender," You'll need some arm candy. It's the perfect accessory for out-of-shape, middle-aged creeps like you. Yeah, I said it! What's your time, Borgnine?"
Leela," Well, so has Fry. What's the big deal?"
Farnsworth," Of course. But only into Beta Crypt 3, a language so complex there's even less chance of understanding it."
Hermes," What the heck is goin' on?! Jefferson, did you sell me some bad rope?!"
Hermes, We think it's better if you don't know.
Bender, That's basically what I do every day.
Fry," Yo! Uh, did two shellfish in scrubs go by?"
Leela, Fry?
Bender," Come on, guys. Pharaoh's countin' on us. Work faster, like this. You call that motivating me? Don't just whip with your arms. The power comes from your hips. Like this."
Leela, Good. That's the last species.
Zoidberg," Well, gang, it looks like we have another mystery on our hands."
Leela," No, they were assassinated. In fact, the law says you'll be killed on the spot if you fail to recite the oath from memory."
Bender," Aww! I think it's sweet. You chopped off your nose so you could look more like your hero. Me, Bender!"
Fry, Spock? Hey! Hey... Do the thing!
Fry, I'll play.
Fry," Leela, I want you to know I think the way you moved those stars around was really wonderful. I got you something."
Fry, Can you believe it? Pharaoh's dead!
Fry," He looks stronger than you, too."
Fry," No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing a tube top and she had a beautiful scaly tail. And I think she had hair extensions."
Leela," I'm sorry, I couldn't stop-- W-Wait. Don't you care that I murdered Hermes?"
Fry, Well at least I did one important thing with my life  Leading good to victory over evil!
Farnsworth," Everyone, listen!"
Leela," That's a popular name today. Little ""e"" big ""B""?"
Amy," Ooh, I feel a little tipsy!"
Fry, Trees down!
Bender," That's using your ass. So, what's the word?"
Bender, Bonjour. May I offer you a box of wine for the edge of the table?
Amy, Great! We're one-tenth of the way there.
Leela, Why do we have to fly within three feet of this penguin preserve on Pluto?
Leela," We should become a commercial airline. I mean, we've got a ship, and teleporters won't be invented for another fifteen years, according to that guy from the future."
Fry, Stop!
Leela, Feministas unite!
Fry," Wait a second. You're a bender, right? We can get out of here if you just bend the bars."
Bender, The cat's out of the bag now!
Farnsworth, Behold  My mutant atomic supermen.
Bender," Uh, hey, Donny, baby, gimme a chance here, huh? Yous guys skedaddle. Let me take care of the doity woik."
Bender," Uh, sure. Anything for you, buddy."
Fry," Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect me."
Bender, That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
Fry," Shoot your weapon, Private!"
Farnsworth, Well then there's only one solution  You need an upgrade to make you compatible with Robot 1-X's new technology.
Bender," That's right, baby. I ain't your lover boy, Flexo, the guy you love so much. You even love anybody pretending to be him."
Bender," Uh, whatever. I ran out of film an hour ago."
Fry, What's happening to me?  Is it puberty?
Hermes," Cover your shame, mon!"
Amy," Stay strong, ladies. We can lose them in the giant miniature golf course."
Farnsworth," Oh, dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop and he's an idiot. Well, that's love for you."
Bender," But why would God think in binary? Unless ... you're not God, but the remains of a computerised space probe that collided with God."
Bender, Aw. That was the greatest uncountably infinite bunch of guys I ever met.
Fry, That's the one.
Leela, I know.
Fry," Bio-units, terminate noise exchange. It is time for you to ingest sandwiches from my compartment."
Bender," You're absolutely right, Fry. Now, if you'll excuse me. I'm off to slay the werewolf of Goblin Mountain."
Leela," It's some kind of hollow tube, devoid of human life. The Los Angeles subway! We can blast our way in and escape!"
Zoidberg, What?
Farnsworth," Hermes, you got your body back. Hurrah!"
Bender," Nibbler! Aw, come here, precious! Look, everyone, it's El Chupanibre."
Zoidberg," So the clover is still in the hiding place, maybe?"
Bender," Fine! Come on, Fry, let's move to that apartment that smelled like a sewer. You liked that one, right?"
Bender, Yo!
Bender, Stupid Franklin‚Äî
Leela," Hello, everyone. I suppose you're wonderin' why my flesh has melded with that of a giant space whale."
Bender," Probably fake, too. There's one way to find out. What?"
Hermes," Well, I always said you were a little forward ... with my wife."
Leela," No, Nibbler! Don't drink the pool water! It's full of chlorine!"
Zoidberg, Hello! So what are you guys doing tonight? I'm up for whatever.
Fry, It got us a lot of customers!
Leela, Come on. We have work to do.
Bender," That was a helluva massage. Maybe the best there ever was. Say, where are we? Rumbledy-Hump?! It's real!"
Farnsworth, Sure! What the heck! I hereby promote you to... Executive delivery boy!
Bender, That's what it says on my vanity plate.
Fry," Ah, now there's something we can all enjoy."
Leela," No, it isn't. You have another 10 years left."
Bender," Welcome to the future, human slave. Ah, relax, chum. I'm not really a giant fly! I'm a horrible robot! Kill all humans!"
Amy, I'm slightly richer!
Bender, Online.
Leela," OK, Bender has her distracted. Now I can shut down her brain by deactivating the carbonated logic matrix. I can't concentrate with this obnoxious candy in my face."
Amy," Well, actually--"
Fry, Hurry up! I wanna see the moon!
Farnsworth," Thank God this log is sturdy. Put on the hat, Guenter! You're the only one who can save us! Stupid monkey."
Fry, Outer space.
Bender, No backsies.
Zoidberg," Oh, the fear!"
Zoidberg, Sure. That's your penis!
Hermes, And just in time to screw up this picture I took!
Hermes," Dream on, woman. I'd like to put the little bastard in a sack and toss the sack in a river and hurl the river into space. But I do like filling out requisitions and these were some doozies! Great Jah's dreadlocks! There's been a mix-up. This isn't a pet licence, it's a fishing licence. And it's mandatory!"
Fry, A man can sneak off to do two things.
Fry, Of course not! But I was willing to lie about it. What more can a man do?
Fry," Hmm, I can see where that would be an advantage. Do you take cash?"
Fry, The moon? The moon moon? Wow! I'm gonna be a famous hero just like Neil Armstrong and those other brave guys no one ever heard of!
Farnsworth," Oh, my!"
Fry, Pfff! You dunno what cold is. I was frozen for a thousand years.
Leela, I'll just have a small injection of Femislim.
Leela," Professor, you'll offer Guenter the hat and, Fry, you'll offer him the banana. We'll let him choose whether he wants to be intelligent or just a mindless animal."
Farnsworth, Fry?
Leela, Help!
Farnsworth, Stop or I'll shoot! Zoidberg?!
Fry, Oh yeah.
Amy," Oh, Kif, it was so romantic of you to rent this paddle plane with your tax rebate. We're like two dandelion seeds wafting on the breeze."
Leela, I don't know. But we can't wait any longer.
Fry," So, who's that weird-looking guy?"
Bender," Whoa! A speakeasy. One prohibited beverage, please."
Leela," Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, but you don't seem like the educated type."
Leela, Is that all you've got? Hi-yah!
Leela, I'll break up with him at dinner.
Leela, It's no use. We were going full speed when we fired him so he's going even faster than that.
Fry," Like this is not the end. But mostly just, I love you, Leela."
Leela, You're doing great!
Hermes, I'll take two. My neck is huge.
Zoidberg, Of course I'll marry you!
Zoidberg, A squid?
Leela," Fry, just be quiet. I'm beginning to think this whole fake fianc√© thing was a terrible, terrible--"
Leela," Well, let's divide up the china. I guess I'll take the NFC helmets and you can have the AFC helmets."
Fry, Are you gonna turn me in for concealing evidence?
Fry, Turanga?
Farnsworth," Oh, dear. I'll have to invent something new in the next ten minutes. Perhaps some sort of death clock."
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. Report to my bedroom for a private exhibition."
Fry," Yes, sir."
Fry, Look. The first fish to crawl up on land.
Fry," Then when I feel so stuffed I can't eat anymore, I just use the restroom, and then I can eat more."
Fry," Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. That'll cool us off."
Fry, Yeah!
Farnsworth," I should fire you three right now, but I'm just not that cold-hearted."
Leela," Hell, yeah!"
Leela," Wow, this is all so confusing."
Bender, This could mean the end of the banana daiquiri as we know it ... also life.
Leela," Zoidberg, we were wrong! We're letting you out so you can kill the Professor!"
Bender, No!
Fry, Wait. You're Pamela Anderson! Cool! What can I get you?
Leela," You call that a wound? That's a boo-boo tops. But thanks for trying to save me, Fry. Fry?! He's... he's dead!"
Bender," You mean ""breakfast club sandwich""?"
Fry," Uh, Bender? Where did you get that bird?"
Bender," Now that's one Bible that doesn't disappoint on every page! Looks like society's running pretty well without my meddling-- Atomic bombs? Oh, no! Those unbelievers from my backside must have found my nuclear pile!"
Bender, A pile of dead bears can only mean one thing. But what?
Fry, Wow! 2801! Anyway...
Leela, And white rhinos.
Bender, This isn't a lousy reform Robanukah! We need more petroleum oil!
Bender," Lowly slave, why are you not working?"
Leela," No, thanks. We're delivering e-waste."
Zoidberg," Oh, the guilt! The unbearable guilt!"
Hermes," Sweet llamas of the Bahamas! Except for that stylish beard, he looks just like Bender!"
Farnsworth, I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me graft a laser cannon onto your chest. To crush those who disobey you. But I guess we're just two different people.
Zoidberg," Ah, I'll just turn the wheel to maximum fastness!"
Fry, Wait! Where do we get the ice?
Fry, I'll meet you up there. I need to check out something first.
Hermes," It's too dark now, but first thing tomorrow we'll slingshot them like they've never been slangshat."
Bender," No, wait, I know these guys. They got nothing."
Leela," Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with Mighty Thor."
Zoidberg," Ambassador Mervin, you killed my lawyer."
Leela, Ew!
Fry, All hail the new captain.
Leela, It's funny how the battle of the sexes was only resolved when a Manbot and a Fembot realised they loved each other.
Bender, Say what?
Hermes," Oh, the irony. I sold my hair so I could buy this third set of combs for Zoidberg."
Fry, Nope. Human.
Zoidberg, I'd like a jumbo squidlog please.
Bender, Here it comes.
Bender, Then shut your yaps and back to work.
Amy, Are you crazy? There's mutants down there! They'll eat you alive.
Leela, Me? Really?
Leela, No. But I'm so thirsty.  This spacesuit is making me sweat like a sow.
Fry, No!
Fry," Aha! Uh, searching ... hmm."
Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for... D. Frosted Wang? Not another crank delivery! Why don't I read these things ahead of time?! One time was funny. But, every week for ten years, not as funny."
Fry," Sheesh! 40,000 channels and only 150 have anything good on."
Bender," Oh, my God!"
Amy, French?
Fry," Well, we destroyed the toy spaceship. Now what are we gonna do?"
Farnsworth, Dr. Banjo?
Fry, Thanks.
Leela, That's me over in Cootietown.
Hermes," Look, you fat fish, the Planet Express health plan only covers one kind of replacement shell."
Amy, Aw!
Leela," Oh, please! Really?"
Leela," Oh, Lord."
Bender, How's this going to get us to Boston?
Hermes," People, please! Let's not overreact‚Äî Death to the crab!"
Leela, I'll give you my hand...
Fry, Phew!
Leela," Arguably, this could be a good thing. The planet has returned to its primeval state."
Bender," Well, so long."
Leela, Duh...
Bender, Baby wants a Zima!
Zoidberg," Hermes, quiet! I'm deducing things."
Fry, Did anyone else see that?
Bender, Ooh!
Leela, Killing them seems like a hassle. Can't we just set it free to live with its own kind?
Fry, Me neither.
Amy," You just have to give guys a chance. Sometimes you meet a guy and think he's a pig, but then later you realise he actually has a really good body."
Farnsworth," No, it won't! The common cold died out five-hundred years ago. And, subsequently, Humanity lost all resistance to its ravages. But the virus survived in you... Frozen for a thousand years."
Fry, Pst. You're holding the bat upside down.
Leela," It sounds too much like those frozen rocky mountain oysters on a stick. You know, Test-cicles?"
Bender," And that's how I defeated Elzar, thanks to Spargle's magic liquid."
Leela," Uh, hello? We haven't made one delivery since you two took over."
Zoidberg, Maid of honor! Ohhh.
Farnsworth, And... ... here we are; the end of the universe.
Fry, Good move.
Fry, No. Tell her she's special.
Farnsworth," Listen to me, you pompous frauds. If I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me. Dean Vernon, I know the truth  It was you driving your hover-car that night, not your horse. Dean Epsilon, I know all about your ""Department of Pool Boy Studies"". And Dr. Wernstrom ... Wernstrom!"
Amy, We're trapped!
Leela, Ow! Can you please remove this anger collar?
Farnsworth, You'll never catch anything with that primitive technology. What you need is this fish pheromone. The most potent aphrodisiac known to fishkind. Uh-oh!
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! You're off to the Tempus Nebula to gather Chronitons."
Fry," I won't be gone long, Seymour. Just wait here till I come back."
Bender," Neat. Say, speaking of whatever the hell you just said, I need to make a cell phone telephone call. Can borrow your cell phone telephone?"
Fry, Yeah!
Fry," Aw, man."
Fry," Wow. Thanks! If you could just quiet down, I wanted to get your opinion of my comic book."
Leela, He'll hunt you down and blast your ass from here to Pakistan.
Fry," Hey, what've you heard?"
Bender, Where--? What the--? Transmission fluid? Where have I been? What happened?
Fry," So what's up, Dr. Schlovinowitz?"
Fry, Bender rules!
Leela, I lost my chance to be a champion. I won't let you throw away yours.
Fry, Wow. You gave up your superintelligence to save us. Why did you come back?
Hermes, Mmm! That'll feel nice on my shattered bones!
Farnsworth, Nine and so on. Three... Two... One.
Bender," Give me my body back, you two-bit thief!"
Zoidberg, I'm not on trial here.
Zoidberg," Like a horse, a turtle, or a cricket."
Fry," Oh uh, I'm late for dinner with Leela."
Leela," Look, I guess you mean well, but isn't that university just a tax-deductible sewer-cleaning service?"
Fry, Where?
Bender," Sorry, mister, but I'm no Bender. I'm just a simple farmer. Name's Billy West!"
Amy," Leela, a little help is nothing to be embarrassed about. Like, maybe I could do your makeup."
Bender, Going? But a captain can't drink without his first mate.
Leela," Hey, Fry! Pizza goin' out. Come on!"
Bender, I cast upon thee a spell of fireball!
Leela, Fry!
Bender, And unlabeled booze! Wide-mouth too!
Bender," Hey, look! Bigfoot! He's back!"
Leela," Hey, guess who I just got off the videophone with?"
Bender," OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 'cause there's no God and your idiotic human ideals are laughable!"
Bender, Yeah! Alright!
Fry, So then my chair tilted back and I almost fell into this freezer thingy.
Farnsworth, Wernstrom!
Hermes," Okay, Bender, you're mortal. And okay, Inspector 5 screwed up. But that just makes the time you have left all the more precious. Do you really want to waste the rest of your life in a bitter, homicidal rage?"
Bender, That's my boy!
Fry, Blunder? You're the only one who's sober. You gotta do somethin'.
Farnsworth, Now see here. We assured our sons that you'd accept their apology.
Farnsworth," Well, I can't keep them in my mouth. They're nuclear-powered!"
Farnsworth," But, dust cakes--"
Amy," Hey, the speedometer only goes up to 80. This thing can't go faster than 80,000 miles an hour?"
Bender," Alright, yup."
Bender," You were right, Fry! From now on I'm going to bend what I want, when I want, who I want! I'm unstoppable!"
Zoidberg," Hurray! Kwanzaa-bot's here to save‚Äî Aw, they killed him."
Bender, Wait. Does that include me?
Fry, Bender? No way! I definitely would've noticed something.
Bender, Activating ice drill.
Fry," No, I.... What?"
Hermes, And the rest.
Zoidberg," If that's his pizza, then I'm icy whatever!"
Bender," I should give you all a beating, But I really have to fly."
Amy," Good, I'm sick of cleaning up those heaps of dead monkeys. But why would you want your mind in a new body?"
Amy, No spluh! Why do you think I'm sitting over here in the stink-free zone?
Fry, I don't care how educational it is. Let's do it!
Leela, An' that's the ultimate secret of the universe?!
Leela, Co-pilot? Under who?
Bender, Does anyone else smell burning dragon beak?
Hermes," Oh, mon! I'm dripping with placenta! Good thing it's Casual Friday."
Fry, Oh. Then I must've fallen asleep.
Fry, Eck! This emotional display is making me nauseous. Or maybe it's whatever that is.
Bender," Please, he's no different from the rest of you organisms; shooting DNA at each other make babies. I find it offensive."
Fry," He-He-He is? Great! Wait, what's the catch?"
Leela," Yeah, but this garbage ball's unstoppable now. New New York is done for."
Zoidberg, Horray! A happy ending for the rich people!
Bender," Hmmm, could be a trick. Let me see your ass, Constantine. Ohh, nice, now I see why she left Fry."
Fry, Don't do it! It's not worth it!
Fry, Dad! Nerd Search '88? What's this?
Fry, Something about seeing it on the Jumbotron makes it so much more real.
Bender," Please, just leave me alone."
Leela," Hi, Fry! I like your blazer."
Farnsworth, Eureka. Another elementary proof of the Goldbach conjecture.]
Leela, For Slurms!
Leela, Never heard of it.
Leela," Yay, Fry!"
Amy," Well, I guess it's time to indulge in some end-of-the-world debauchery.  Who's up for an orgy?"
Amy, Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?
Leela," Please, Bender. Have some malt liquor. If not for yourself then for the people who love you."
Leela, And Nappster says illegal copies never hurt anybody.
Bender," August 6, 1991."
Zoidberg, I'm acting astonished.
Leela, I know.
Bender," Of course, who said I wasn't?"
Leela, I'd like to see him try.
Bender, Missed me!
Fry, I gotta find that golden bottle-cap.
Leela, They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly saved the Octillian System from a horde of rampaging Killbots.
Bender," You got it, genius."
Bender," Don't be a prude, Fry!"
Farnsworth," Oh, dear Lord!"
Farnsworth, Look! Inside its pouch. Extinct Tasmanian tigers.
Amy, Uh...
Fry," His name was Seymour. He was once intimate with the leg of a wandering saxophonist. He had wet dog smell, even when dry. And he was not above chasing the number 29 bus."
Fry," Earth is dangerous. I fell off my chair there once. Ow! Quit it, Earth."
Farnsworth," 100,000. That's why I hid it here, under my mattress."
Fry, What?
Bender," Oh, I made myself feel bad."
Bender, I doubt it!
Bender, Yep. Mind-numbingly interesting. Ooh!
Amy, We all hope they're communicating a peaceful message!
Farnsworth," Well nuts to me. I'm taking the stage! I know the source of the greenhouse gases. But in my shame I've kept it secret for 75 long years. Oh, it haunts my memory still."
Fry, Oh. That explains these boat eggs.
Leela, Can I please just go back to prison?
Leela, Son of a... Ow!
Leela, No.
Farnsworth," Amy, technology isn't intrinsically good or evil. It's how it's used. Like the death ray."
Bender, Shut the hell up!
Hermes," There'll be no promotions unless somebody dies. And, even then, only if we can bring 'em back as a zombie like Scruffy."
Leela," We're not Adam and Eve.  You see, due to a series of‚Äî"
Bender, Oh.
Fry, Gotcha!
Leela," I'm a fool. The fans haven't been cheering for me, they've been cheering at me."
Bender, Hey! Can't you see I'm using the toilet?
Leela, That's not true. I have one right here that can talk.
Zoidberg, Kill 'em both!
Fry, How your football team?
Farnsworth, Me.
Amy," I do! Kiss me, Kif!"
Farnsworth," There. I've finished fine-tuning my What-If machine. It can answer any ""What-If"" question, accurate to within one-tenth of a plausibility unit."
Fry," Bender, no! You don't have to do something just 'cause it's gonna happen! The future's making a chump outta you!"
Farnsworth, Pandora.
Leela, Why is that good news?
Bender," Woah, woah, woah! How come we get off for every dumb human holiday but not for robot holidays?"
Leela," Maybe I'm havin' some kinda... Early-life crisis, but... Look  Don't you ever wonder about the future?"
Hermes," Aw, well isn't that-- Ew!"
Leela, What? What do you mean?
Leela, You haven't been to work in three days. What have you been doing?
Bender, Whoa! Scuse me.
Fry, Uh-huh. And I guess now maybe I can get to know the real Lucy Liu.
Fry, Guess I better head over to my night job.
Fry, How's that robot I ran over?
Leela, Are you crazy? We have to keep our secret identities secret.
Leela," Okey-doke. One sunny, funny day, there was an unfamiliar visitor in Rumbledy-Hump."
Leela, Then our only hope to talk to them is by doing a peace dance. But it will have to be smoother an' more fluid than any movement mankind is capable of.
Hermes," No way, mon. He's fakin' it. He really is gone. Everyone, put on your takin'-off caps."
Bender, Here you go.
Amy, Ew!  He sneezed in it!
Bender, The what now?
Fry, But...
Farnsworth, I saw it on TV in that episode where Bender shot Calculon. How cool was that?
Hermes," Ooh, that's snug! Oh, those haven't descended in years."
Zoidberg, Aha!
Zoidberg, Poor Bender.
Bender, I was born on an assembly line in the bad part of Tijuana.
Hermes, I know how to settle this  We'll check last night's surveillance tapes.
Fry, Please... Stop the monster. Just do that one thing.
Hermes," It's supposed to be about the filing! People! We didn't choose to be bureaucrats, No, that's what almighty Jah made us, We treat people like swine, And make 'em stand in line, Even if nobody paid us!"
Leela, There. See? It was no big thing.
Zoidberg," It's been an honour to serve under you, sir!"
Leela, This toads the wet sprocket. What about out thousands of shares of stock?
Bender," Yo, Highness. Uh, just out of robo-curiosity, why would you use a guy's nose for an aphrodisiac instead of his, you know, wing-dang-doodle?"
Fry, That was great!
Farnsworth," I suppose there could be a minute quantity of petroleum left. But it would be insanely deep within the Earth, at pressures so dangerously high that‚Äî"
Fry, Who's the lucky lobsterina?
Leela, Whoa!
Bender," Doo, doo-doo-doo, doo, doo-doo, doo, doo, doo-Doo, DOO!"
Bender, Uh-oh.
Zoidberg," Huh? What's this? A card from my cousin Zoidfarb. Instead of ""Claus"" he writes ""Claws""! Now that's humorous. Today's comedians could learn from this card."
Bender," It's not about the money, Nixon, though I'd like much more. She's committed 30 felonies in 12 star systems. If no one stops her, she'll break my record for longest rap sheet."
Hermes, Bender's right! Kill it before someone names it!
Leela, Dad! I'm underage!
Hermes, No! That body's the cornerstone of my marriage. What's LaBarbara going to do?
Fry," Hey, buddy."
Amy, Right on!
Hermes," Go on, stick, touch me! Can't do it!"
Leela," What are you, on a diet?"
Zoidberg," Oh, no! My deal is doing the thing!"
Farnsworth," No, I need it shipped to my office at Mars University. It's a little experiment that may well win me the Nobel Prize."
Leela," I know you like cooking shows but you're a robot, you don't even have a sense of taste."
Bender," On, Trasher! On, Smasher! Hey, Kwanzaabot, where you off to?"
Farnsworth," And you, my faithful fiend! How can I ever repay you?"
Amy," Oh, Kif, it's like a movie with this happening in it."
Bender," Aw, come on! I've got a lot of ransom notes to send!"
Fry," And the Professor's a senile, amoral crackpot. Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant."
Fry, My God! She's gone. Everyone I ever knew or cared about is gone.
Farnsworth," Oh, no? Back when I was full of piss and vinegar, and my bed wasn't, I fell in love with the sweetest girl to ever skip through a field of posies. Her name was Eunice, and we spent our blissful days working in a lab, developing a poison to wipe out that dreadful posy infestation. I thought our love would last forever. But then, 43 years later, she left me for a robot! How could she do that to me, her Farnypoo?"
Hermes," Concerning our pest problem  Somebody's been leaving food around and it's attracting owls. And I, for one, am getting tired of cleaning those owl traps. Now... As this shocking graph indicates, our water consumption has tripled in the last month. I notice Fry has been here for a month, so I'm appointing him head of a committee to find who's responsible. Fry? Am I cracking up, or is Fry's living here starting to get in the way of bus--"
Fry," Hey, I'm on TV."
Bender, Ah!
Fry, Yes! Footprints! And hand prints? But? What's happening?
Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You're a thousand years old? Your bio says you're 27!"
Fry, Huzzah!
Amy," Professor, you did it! You solved the problem that baffled Einstein an' drove Stephen Hawking to quit physics and become a cartoon voice actor!"
Leela, Fat chance.
Bender," Uh, don't mind if I do. Ow! What's in these things?"
Bender, Yeah! Now are you gonna come to the squid fights with us or sit here wallowing in your prehistoric junk?
Fry, And I'm his uncle!
Leela, That's good!
Zoidberg, Hooray! Free sky sticks! Ooh. Police brutality!
Zoidberg," Edna, I couldn't stand it any longer. I-- Fry!"
Bender," My God. You stole all your ideas from those poor, innocent creatures and hogged all the credit?! I underestimated you."
Farnsworth," You can barely remember your own name, Einstein."
Zoidberg," Yes, my liege!"
Fry," Wait, what happened to the snakes and the frogs? I need to know!"
Farnsworth," Oh, oh, yes, the announcement! As you all know, I am not long for this world."
Bender," A hush comes over the crowd. The only sound is Bender calling everyone else a jerk as he swings! Oh, he slices! Into the water! Oh, man! Boy, I tell you, buddy!"
Amy," But you still have them, right?"
Amy, We're just going through a rough patch.
Fry," Well, got to skedoodle-oodle. We're taking a cuddle-cab to Hug-a-Bunny Village."
Fry, What does that look like?
Farnsworth," Oh, I should think so. Although last time aliens invaded all they did was force the most intelligent of us to pair off and mate continuously. Oh, yes!"
Fry, You're back from the dead?!
Leela," You don't have to apologize.  In fact, I came to thank you."
Farnsworth, Poor little guy starved to death.
Leela, And not one of those bogus everyday miracles like a sunrise. Aren't you a male?
Farnsworth, Play time is fun time.
Fry, No.
Amy," Hey, Professor, what's all this scloop, glorking out of the machine?"
Fry," That's it. I've had it with women. From now on, I'm concentrating on my career. Can I have my old job back?"
Leela," No one's wearing anything adorable over their head. Now listen, I could never, ever be ashamed of my parents. I'll see you this weekend."
Farnsworth, Never fear. My magic fingers still know how to do their stuff!
Farnsworth," The only question is, ""Who should be our spokesman?!"""
Fry, I consider myself a reasonable man. Quick with a joke. Slow to anger. But Bender can't go on long car trips anymore an' I say Zoidberg must die!
Hermes," Oh, yes!"
Fry, That's good.
Amy," Oh, baby soft!"
Zoidberg, Oh.
Farnsworth, The Farnsworths are a remarkable‚Äî
Farnsworth," You should be ashamed of yourself, Fry. You'd have to be blind not to notice that Leela's a cyclops."
Fry, No!
Zoidberg, They're flying Manhattan into the Sun! They must've been outta piranhas.
Leela, To have parents.
Farnsworth, What the hell are you talking about?
Bender, What are you? Some kind of galactic computer?
Zoidberg," I used to hang out here as a larva. It looked so much bigger back then. Who's the tough guy now, Vinnie?"
Bender," ...six, seven, eight!"
Leela," Oh, Lord."
Fry, These new hands are great. I'm gonna break 'em in tonight.
Fry, It sure was nice of the Mayor's wife to have sex with me. Huh?
Bender," Hey, chumps, I heard you were on the ass-end of an ass-kicking so I figured you could use a couple these little babies."
Bender," Cheer up, meatbag. You've barely touched your amoeba."
Hermes, See you at din-din!
Farnsworth," Don't sit in there, you idiot! That's dangerous! Wha? No wonder this contraction isn't aerodynamic! It's not an aircraft, it's a spacecraft!"
Bender," Hey, this is starting to feel pretty good!"
Fry, Cool! Let's see this one!
Zoidberg, No time for an injection. Uh! I'll be damned. It did make 'im a double Yeti!
Hermes," Maybe you're just a fantastic lover, Fry."
Amy," Hey, that's my cellphone!"
Leela, I think you're over reacting.
Fry, Huh. So it was hiding deep down inside o' me? Like my skeleton bones?
Fry, What if I refuse?
Fry, Leela's gonna die. What would Delivery-Boy Man do?
Amy, Yee-ha!
Bender, What now?
Fry, I didn't mean to. He just looked so cool and refreshing.
Bender, You know it!
Zoidberg, Stop!
Bender, Upsy-daisy.
Bender, Not Santa!
Leela," My god, I can't believe I'll never see that particular Fry again."
Bender, What's with all the crap?
Hermes, The Central Bureaucracy maintains records on all bureaucrats. We should be able to look up Inspector 5.
Leela," Uh, were you just singing?"
Leela, Maybe you could do more reps with less weight.
Zoidberg," Now I am the most important doctor at the delivery company where I work. But, sadly, my life is bereft of laughter."
Fry," Oh, yeah, no, you're pretty perfect."
Bender," I accept this Nobel peace prize not just for myself, but for crime robots everywhere. Sk√•l!"
Bender," Yeah, if you're in the grave dust."
Fry, That's marriage alright!
Bender," Well, everybody, I just saved a turtle. What have you done with your lives?"
Farnsworth, Eh-wha?
Bender," Hey, let's all join the Reform Party!"
Leela, Yeah... Can anyone fix my ship so I can get home?
Zoidberg, ... there I was in the dumpster enjoying a moldy fudgesicle when suddenly your hand flies over and slaps me in the tokhes.
Bender," For the love of God, somebody kick his ass!"
Amy, Shoo! Stay away from my babies!
Leela, Ocean madness.
Bender, Whoa! Someone had a busy day.
Leela," Well, we just need one of those big ice cubes. Someone should call the losers who are supposed to deliver it. Hello?"
Amy," Bender, you can't be an Ultimate Robot Fighter. It's the most brutal form of competition in the galaxy!"
Leela, I should've listened to my crew. That space whale wasn't a monster. It was the obsession of me and others like me that made it into a monster.
Leela," Bender, what's wrong?"
Fry, Don't do it! He's evil!
Fry," So, heads or tails?"
Leela," OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can."
Leela," Hey, Fry. I know something you could lay bare."
Fry," What's the point of Xmas when everyone you know died a thousand years ago? I'm the loneliest person on Earth. Hey, Leela, how 'bout a little sympathy here, huh? Yoiks! What was that about?"
Zoidberg," Oh! I have no shares! Wait! My sangwich! Has it also appreciated in value? Please, oh, please!"
Fry, There is? Yay!
Hermes, Yeah.
Fry, Nothing.
Bender, What's that? One of those Led Zeppelins I've heard so much about?
Farnsworth, The ruffians smoked one of your cigars.
Farnsworth, The time skips are worse than ever now. Isolated spots are jumping by years at a time. Look.
Bender," Hey, it's easy to criticize."
Bender, But I destroyed the technology of the world. I ran on the beach and felt the sand between my foot cups.
Bender, So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel?
Hermes, Sweet squid of Madrid! The tentacle got Fry!
Bender," Yes, sir. I'm on it!"
Leela, At least you didn't smell as bad as them.
Fry, Nope. Uh-uh. Ew! Now look. This is the nose we want. Did you sell it to somebody?
Leela, Damn right I was!
Hermes," Kingston rules. Two men go down, one come up."
Bender, Now I can punch you in the nose in the dark.
Amy, Fluh! She's an orphan.
Hermes, I'd better make a chart of the suspects. I'll begin by drawing a line with my straight-edge. Sweet lamprey of Santa Fe! My edge has been bent!
Fry," Leela, freak out later. We're not done escaping yet!"
Leela, Could you guys please stop talking about my personal life?
Amy," Oh, no!"
Amy, Uh-oh. I'm terrible at parallel parking.
Bender, OK! I'm done re-kafoobling the energy motron ... or whatever.
Leela," I don't know what happened, but we've taken on a lot of clocks. Let's get back home."
Bender, I thought you were retired.
Bender, Oop! Sorry.
Fry, Did we go too far? What time is it?
Bender, I make use of my rod of fireballs.
Bender, Boo! Bring on Bender! Boo! Bender's the greatest!
Fry, Bender? You stole the atom?
Fry," Man, even the news monster is acting strange. What are we gonna do?"
Leela," Fry, please-- (from outside) My ponytail's caught in the door."
Leela, Don't look at me!  I'm a freak!
Fry, Cool. I can't wait to tell Leela.
Fry, Also Wolfman!
Bender, He was so sweet.
Leela, She's got a fine coat.
Fry, I'm just glad we hit something. I thought we'd never stop.
Bender, There's no backup copy of me?
Farnsworth, I'm a cold-blooded punk!
Hermes," Listen, you filthy crab, a thousand years ago there was a legendary team of Jamaican bobsledders."
Hermes," Bender, mon, lie yourself down. You're payin' for that!"
Fry," Actually, we've met once before."
Bender," Whoa, mama! Hold still, sexy lady."
Leela," But, Mr. Barker--"
Fry," Uh, I'm flattered, really. If I was gonna do it with a big, freaky mud bug you'd be way up the list!"
Bender, Let me go! I don't even want the stupid beer! Yes! You tried to trick me into coming out of my chest. But who has the beer now? I've got mail!
Leela, We'll be crushed if we don't equalise the pressure.
Leela," You know, Doug, most guys are put off by my eye. It's nice to finally meet someone who's open-minded. Ew!"
Fry," No, not the explosion!"
Fry, Ten ... ... nine--
Leela, That's not torpedo three. That's not torpedo three at all!
Farnsworth," Wait! If we could build an object the exact size, density and consistency of the garbage ball, it might just knock the ball away without smashing it to bits."
Fry, I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely moral to--
Bender," Right here! I'm comin'! C'mon, baby! I'll do it! C'mon, Mom!"
Bender," Hey, look. The suns are setting. I can finally switch to hard liquor!"
Bender, We all feel like that all the time. You don't hear us gassin' on about it.
Leela, Yeah. You got a tele-sonic transmission from Kif a couple hours ago.
Leela," I'm sorry, femi-sisters, but it pooped out around 3 00 a.m. Poor thing couldn't take another bite."
Zoidberg, Hooray! I'm a teenage heartthrob again!
Fry, I'm literally angry with rage! Your co-stars may be gone but we can still get those episode tapes back for the whole world to see. Come on!
Fry, That doesn't sound too bad.
Zoidberg, And hundreds of black hovercopters are coming to welcome us!
Fry, Fry's dog!
Amy, Just act normal and switch to a garlic shampoo.
Leela, Fry first of all this is serious. And second of all...
Amy," Hermes, no! I'll ruin your body, too!"
Bender," So there's more Benders around. As far as I'm concerned, that's good news!"
Farnsworth," Yes, I remember."
Amy, My javelin too! It's ruined. Now we'll never beat Jupiter State.
Fry," Eh, what's the worst thing that could happen? Ugh! It's like a party in my mouth and everyone's throwing up!"
Leela, For your information it's called Electric Mucus.
Leela," Professor, we have no power."
Fry, Oh. How is it?
Leela, It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution.
Fry, Damn.
Amy, Sh! Don't let anyone hear you say that!
Leela, What are we gonna do? Fry can't pretend to be both our boyfriends.
Fry, Look. I've been studying how to pilot the ship. Impressed?
Leela, They were?! By who?!
Bender," The important thing is, by my standards, I won fair and square. Now, who wants brunch? Cooked with plenty of ... ""confidence""?"
Amy," Speaking of sappy love... Want to tell them, Kiffy?"
Fry, He's at a spa.
Farnsworth, To the ship!
Bender, And this is just last year at Space Mardi Gras.
Bender," Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can we have a week off?"
Fry, Follow him! It's our only way out!
Bender," No, of course not! It was ... uh ... porno! Yeah, that's it!"
Zoidberg, Thank you. I made them myself.
Amy, Don't give up.  You just need more titillating twits.
Leela, Uh-oh. Isn't Franklin in Philadelphia?
Fry, Build-A-Bot Workshop? It's time to start living again!
Farnsworth," Larry, the snivelling middle child."
Bender," Ooh! Ooh! Bubblegum? My name's Bender and I'm a huge fan of your work, both on and off the court. Can I be a Globetrotter?"
Hermes," Bender, mon, no one's trying to run you over. Stop being a big, hallucinating baby."
Leela," Just make a simple cake. And this time, if someone's going to jump out of it, make sure you put them in after you cook it."
Leela, Sh!
Farnsworth," Dr. Zoidberg, I want to see you right now!"
Bender," With all these women around they were probably nagged to death. Are you with me, fellas?"
Leela, No!
Bender," Well, let's get started."
Zoidberg," For one beautiful night, I knew what it was to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honoured."
Leela," It was very sweet of you, Bender."
Bender," Ah, they'll probably find a cure for that in the future."
Hermes," Four, three..."
Fry," Ooh, yeah. Anyone have a camera?"
Bender, We interrupt this ancient prophecy to bring you late-breaking bulletin. He hammers the back of his head and creates and imprint of himself on the wall.
Bender," Welcome to Plan Am Flight 1 to Acapulsar. The local time on Acapulsar is five years from now. In the event of a wormhole sendin' us back in time, do not kill your parents. If you who are travelling with small children, help them not to kill you before not killin' your own parents. Now please turn off all electronic devices."
Bender," Uh, I'm gettin' dizzy! I can't walk straight!"
Bender, I don't need friends. I need a sex change operation and give it to me now!
Bender, Awful! Boo! This kid sucks! We want Bender! Boo!
Bender," Hey, that's not that bad."
Leela, At least we got a few mildly interesting stories out of it.
Bender," Man, I guess it's harder than I thought to make someone cry."
Amy, Is cash okay?
Leela," Bender, a turtle isn't yourself. Why do you care about it?"
Fry, Bender!
Bender," Listen, you fat Internet nerd."
Leela, I told them something so shocking that they let me by.
Bender, All the coolest robots are in this fraternity.
Farnsworth, One month. Two weeks. One hour. Thirty seconds and here we‚Äî
Leela," Bender, it's OK to be proud but don't be a show-off."
Farnsworth, She was a wise woman.
Leela," This is, by a wide margin, the least likely thing that has ever happened."
Bender," How 'bout a few words, Professor?"
Bender, I bet watching me bend girders like this turns your legs all rubbery.
Leela," Okay, Plan B. Everyone knows men have one fatal weakness - they can't resist hookers. Dixie, Trixie, you know what to do."
Amy, A whole forest grew overnight.
Amy, I recognise this! It's the 1960s! I did a report on it for my drug-taking class.
Zoidberg," What? It's not even scratch and sniff? But if rich people think it's good, I'll buy it. One art, please!"
Bender," Oh yeah? Well, maybe this is him in a costume. I'm gonna squeeze you out of there like Tijuana toothpaste."
Fry," But things are different this time. Before, she was demanding and possessive. But now she wants me to do stuff and stay with her all the time."
Fry, I'm scaroused!
Farnsworth," I shouldn't be out in this cold. I 'ave no protective fat, hair, or warm blood. I'm not even legally a mammal."
Bender, It wasn't just a blast it was a sacred tribute to my ancestral prototypes which happened to take the form of a drinking contest.
Bender, And that's how I saved Earth and am the greatest!
Bender, Probably not. But I love you and I'm gonna kick his ass till I win you back.
Leela, Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?
Fry, Guenter! You're alive!
Farnsworth, That's just stupid.
Bender," There! Now when I'm found in a million years people will know what the score was. Hey! what's bombarding me? Oh, no! An asteroid field. If even a pea-sized asteroid were to whiz through my skull it could-- Ow! Hurt slightly! Well that was fun. Now for eons of loneliness."
Bender," Hey, All My Circuits! Move over."
Leela, So we can go back to Earth?  But there is no Earth anymore!  Everyone I know is dead!
Leela," Hmm, he seems pretty angry."
Bender, Ahhhhh.
Bender, That's L.A. for you.
Bender," Oh! FYI, I dropped that Tetris piece in the wrong place and ended the game."
Zoidberg," Finally, I have a good claw. See? Three human females, a number and a king giving himself brain surgery."
Amy," C'mon, Mushu! Barf! Barf like a freshman!"
Fry, I'll save one of you!
Leela," I'm back at the wheel, Fry. Everything's under control."
Bender, Let's find out.
Leela, Huh? It's him!
Leela," So, Fry, was the real moon anything like the moon you used to dream about?"
Hermes," Okay, I finished moving the last grand piano. Now can we have our pizza?"
Farnsworth, It's the same on Earth.
Fry, OK.
Bender," Foolish leprechaun, I scoop your treasure in the name of the fancy men."
Bender," Then please let me explain, My crimes were merely boy-ish pranks."
Farnsworth, This is a top secret military satellite launched by the Air Force in 1998.
Bender," Hey, pal, help me out here. This is the worst possible hand, right?"
Hermes, But then we'll have no fuel.
Amy, Kif!
Fry, To the end of the universe.
Bender, You're moving in with her? Why can't she move in with us? I could just curl up at the foot of the bed. (WHIMPERING)
Fry, Yowza! I know what I want for dessert!
Leela, Who's up for one last summer beach trip?
Leela," Uh, Professor?"
Fry, Leela's right. That's not what you want to hear. What you want to hear is that I fixed my comic book. Now the hero is more reliable because he has no more ridiculous powers.
Bender, Not my fault if you don't check me! Messages erased.
Fry, Not even a card.
Bender, What comes out one end we feed to the other.  Also Indian food.  Let the contest begin!
Fry," No, it's about you and me."
Fry, What are you showing right now?
Fry, Oh. Is there a burn ward within 10 feet of here?
Fry, Who wants to know?
Zoidberg," Thank you, Hubert."
Fry, And... Woil√†!
Leela, I'm not afraid.
Bender, I'm not giving my name to a machine.
Amy," Gee, I see CGI. IGC ees I, eej."
Bender, Boo! Not as good as Bender! Boo!
Farnsworth," That? It's, uh ... nothing. Yes, nothing. If you think it's anything, you're a suspicious moron."
Bender, Neat!
Fry," I'll protect you, Leela!  My love is stronger than the vast majority of explosions!"
Bender, Whoa! I'm not reading that crap. Summarise it in one word.
Leela, No! You've got to do it. I don't care how suicidal it is.
Fry, At last! At last I have the power to make Leela love me.
Fry, But existing is basically all I do!
Hermes, He has a daddy!
Hermes, I don't know how this was suppose to work.
Bender," Man, the future is a total craphole. Whoever lives here is a crapface sack of crap. No offence, fellows."
Fry," Fine, Mr. Responsible, don't use the code. Mmmmm. That pizza sure was good."
Fry," Help me! For God's sake, help me!"
Farnsworth," Look, the spirit of Kwanzaa is killing the parasites."
Leela, Anything?
Bender," Uh, you don't need to kill us, Planet Express Ship ... because ... I love you. Oh, yeah, baby! I feel like doing stuff for you and stuff."
Leela, I should've told the truth right away. These simply prairie folk have a simple prairie-ish life here. And I was wrong to exploit it for profit.
Bender," Yeah, this past week with Fry's been a blast! Y'know, beneath this warm, sunny exterior beats the cold, mechanical heart of a robot."
Bender, He could make a good...
Bender, I don't know and I don't care!
Fry," Are you crazy, Professor?"
Fry," It's not fair. In my day Xmas was supposed to bring people together, not blow them apart!"
Bender," 'Cause he's a loser, that's why. He's the lobster equivalent of Fry."
Leela, And there's that robot child actor who grew up and became a convenience store!
Zoidberg, Mmm!
Fry, Yay!
Leela, That is completely reckless. Don't you ever think ahead?
Leela, And hard-working.
Fry, What proof is this? Some huge number?
Fry, So? What do you think?
Leela," Aww, look how cuddly he looks in his new cape!"
Fry," Hey, hey, cheer up. Not everyone turns out like their parents. I mean, look at me. My folks were honest, hard-working people."
Leela," Now if you see any robots, just stay out of their way. So far, so good."
Hermes, Yeah-heah!
Amy, You stink!
Fry, Yeah!
Bender, Who-y-boy?
Farnsworth," Now, now, there'll be plenty of time to discuss your objections when and if you return."
Fry, Fabulous friends!
Fry," Yeah, it's really long. But what did you just turn on with it?"
Fry, How's that?
Hermes," Happy Xmas, Xmas people! Xmas cards have arrived! Xmas! Amy, there you go. Fry, Professor, Zoidberg, a mighty haul for Bender."
Leela, Where's the Professor?
Leela," Wake up? Oh, no! No! It can't be!"
Leela," Bender, do something."
Zoidberg, There's nothing crazy about it. It's just Freedom Day!
Fry," Bender, I think you might be playing too much Dungeons & Dragons."
Amy, No! There!
Hermes," OK, Captain, this is just a standard legal release protecting Planet Express from lawsuits in the event of the unforeseen."
Farnsworth," Eh, wha? I mean, what?"
Bender," And finally, a chump, to be caught on video and later arrested."
Fry, 'Cause you're a robot?
Leela," Plus, you have the high beams on!"
Fry," Hey, the TV's getting away!"
Farnsworth, Happy!
Farnsworth," I am the Professor, great and ... uh ... forgetful! Now, what do you nice kids want?"
Zoidberg," Ain't got no cash, Ain't got no style, Ladies vomit when I smile, But does Zoidberg worry? Feh! You wish!"
Amy, I hate chiseling right after a manicure. Oh! Darn it! I broke off one of my fingers!
Fry, Hello? Has anyone out there seen Bender?
Hermes, Who's brave now?
Fry, Yes!
Leela," Ooh, ancient Wall Street."
Fry, Alright! I'm a delivery boy!
Bender," Legion of Benders, come onto me. We have one thing to do!"
Fry," Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm."
Leela," So, uh, how's rehearsal going?"
Leela, We'll go wait in the ship.
Fry," Uh, sorry, Bender, that's just a phone booth."
Leela, Absolutely. Bullhorns are a core principle of eco-feminism.
Farnsworth, The year one billion.
Fry, I really like it!
Leela, All right!
Fry," Oh, no, it's the Cyclops! Don't look! Don't look!"
Fry, What? Really?
Farnsworth," Uh, wha? Oh, yes! They say madness runs in our family. Some even call me mad! And why? Because I dared to dream of my own race of atomic monsters. Atomic supermen with octagonal-shaped bodies that suck blood out of..."
Leela," Bender's not a guy, he's a robot."
Fry, Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? Was anybody hurt?
Leela," There's a political debate on! Quick, change the channel!"
Fry, I've not heard of them.
Zoidberg," Don't lecture me about Alien physiology, Conrad! The pineal neurotoxin neutralises the adrenal neurotoxin. That's why Yetis don't drive themselves mad!"
Bender, She's gone.
Zoidberg, You've seen me naked?
Bender," I'm talkin' about Robanukah, the holiest six and a half weeks in the robot calendar!"
Leela, How ultra?
Bender," Where would the Professor be without students who love and respect him? Right there! But seriously, of all the former crew members of the Professor's delivery ship, our next speaker is by far the most alive. Captain Musky?"
Amy," I think cosmetic surgery's great, Leela. I used to be too cute, so I had cuteness-reduction surgery here ... ... and here."
Fry, Who are you people?
Bender," Yes, sir, sir!"
Amy, You idiot!
Fry, Hooray!
