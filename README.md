# Futurama- Who Said It?
## Description
This classification project explores the task of matching character labels to lines of dialogue from a TV show. I obtained a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josephvm/futurama-seasons-16-transcripts/data) of the lines of dialogue from the show Futurama, trimmed it to include the lines from the 7 most frequent characters (enumerated below), and trained various model configurations using scikit-learn on the set of lines to predict which character it came from.
