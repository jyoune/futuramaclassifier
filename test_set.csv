Bender," Poor? Oh, crap."
Bender, How much more?
Fry," Man, I wish we had a Robot to do stuff."
Amy," Leela, we need to talk. You've gone from crazy like a fox to crazy like Fox News!"
Zoidberg," I'm feeling less nuts, thank you, because tomorrow I will be depositing my jelly in the cloacal vents of a female. If you catch my drift."
Farnsworth, You lie!
Zoidberg," You get an infinite number of meat dishes, and a free refill on the soda."
Zoidberg," ""Dog food"", you say?"
Leela, Wait! What's wrong?
Amy, For Slurms!
Leela," Are you sure Fry is working for your father? It just doesn't seem like him to be so evil, or to hold down a job."
Bender, Bender? That walking wuss factory?
Leela, Hello.
Hermes," You better tell her, Fry."
Bender," Admit it. You felt something for me tonight. And by ""me"" I mean Flexo."
Bender," In that case it's something I've always wanted to make up to you. Hey, scratchmo. How 'bout dropping me and the lady some rump-rattling beats?"
Bender, This guy's too trustworthy. What's his angle?
Hermes, The bureaucra-scan won't let anyone but the assigned bureaucrat log in.
Fry, This is nothing. Back in high school I used to drink a hundred cans of cola a week. Right up until my third heart attack.
Bender, Got it. I'll show the utmost discretion as we get nasty in this glass tube.
Fry," This is huge! Bender, why don't I just live in here?"
Farnsworth," Well, dark matter is extremely valuable as starship fuel. That's why it was all mined out, leaving the planet completely hollow."
Leela," Fry, no. This is my first mission and I'm not gonna let us get in any trouble. Besides, the car's on a track."
Bender," No! Oh, they're tormenting me with up-tempo singing and dancing."
Farnsworth, Hwhaa?
Bender, I can hit it with a shovel.
Leela, Impressive. They're busting mad rhymes with an 80% success rate.
Fry," Okay, but don't restart my Tetris. I was finally about to get one of those pieces that looks like a backwards ""L."""
Fry," Um, I have a question. What if Bender was really giant?"
Amy, Was it out in front of Discount Shoe Outlet?
Fry," Wow! There's a million aliens. I've never seen anything so mind-blowing. Ooh, a reception table with muffins!"
Bender," Okay. Here goes. Visor down. I believe, I believe. I did it! I imagined something. For 1.3 milliseconds, I truly believed I was a noble robot in days of yonder."
Amy, Maid of honor!
Leela," There won't be any imploding once they read our environmental review. Right, Professor?"
Bender, Bite my colossal metal ass!
Leela, You had cable. This is satellite.
Bender, You mean this junk?
Bender, What the hell was that?
Fry, Alright!
Fry," Look, Guenter, if you're so miserable here, maybe you should just go back to the jungle."
Leela, Quick.
Fry, Uh ... hmm ... do you have any food?
Bender," Alright, Amy, you win! The mob did it. I saw the whole thing while also having hot sex with the Donbot's daughter. I'm scared and great at sex!"
Fry, Blech! We have to track down my nose before some alien snarfs it and does the worm. Who's in?
Zoidberg, Ask her to mate with me.
Leela," I miss you, too, Fry. And you probably think what I'm doing is wrong. But it's something I really care about..."
Bender," Well, if jacking on'll make strangers think I'm cool, I'll do it!"
Leela," Goodbye, Fry."
Fry," Xmas, huh? Y'know, this'll be my first Xmas away from home."
Zoidberg," Oh, Danny-boy, The pipes, the pipes are calling--"
Leela, Well ... I guess so. Just be careful. I'd like to hold off any major screw-ups until at least my second day as captain.
Leela," Uh, g-- uh, getting back to the, uh, matter, uh-uh, if it please the court... Fry, there's nothing else here. You only wrote two pages of dialogue."
Leela, I'm taking evasive action.
Bender," I'm telling you, Fry, they've got a chatroom for everybody. And here it is."
Bender," Look, pal, you've only got one set of clothes and you're not taking them off while I'm here. Well, I'm bushed. G'night."
Fry, Definitely. Or... Somewhere else.
Bender," Alright, baby!"
Zoidberg, Both good. The important thing is I'm meeting new people.
Leela, I did!
Bender, What's this for?
Bender, Uh...got you...you muderous...flesh piles!
Fry, Huh? Planet Express Ship? Is that you?
Fry, I can't tell you.
Fry, I don't get it.
Fry," Fancy cigar. Why don't you smoke it already? Puff, puff! Go, go, go, go, go!"
Leela, That beautiful violet star?
Amy, I was just checking out his tats. Sneato! I have one of my mom. Wanna see?
Zoidberg, 100!
Bender," Oh, Greenland is a barren land, A land that bears no green, Where there's ice and snow, And the whale fishes blow, And the--"
Bender," When I grow up, I wanna be a steam shovel!"
Fry, Eightsevensixfivefourthreetwooneblastoff!
Bender," Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! I hope it's me!"
Bender, Bath what?
Fry, Everything's changed.
Bender, We'll be back after this word from Crazy Bender's Discount Stereo.
Leela, You have no sympathy for anyone else's feelings.
Fry, Alright!
Farnsworth," Wha? Uh, gotta go. Uh, fight club!"
Fry, Now I get it!
Zoidberg," Performing? What? Please, if someone could spare me money to buy shoes--"
Hermes," Stop it, Fry! That's sexual harassment!"
Fry, I don't like this place. It's 120 degrees and there's very little oxygen.
Hermes," Dark matter costs have tripled, so we must reduce expenses. Therefore, we will no longer provide complimentary porno magazines in the lounge."
Fry," Man, I don't wanna hurt Bender's feelings..."
Bender, I tried to run you over?
Fry, Like me!
Amy," Y'know, if you still want your land, we could just trade back for it."
Bender," Coma, coma, coma, coma, coma, chameleon!"
Leela," So, if you're not sure if it's alive or dead, Poke it with a stick and lick the stick instead."
Leela, Ow!
Bender, Ow.
Fry, Where is it?
Zoidberg, Super model!
Hermes, Why not?
Fry," No, I didn't!"
Fry," No, we should at least deliver the news in person. Our universe has always tried to be classy."
Bender," Uh, pardon me, my good simpleton. Could you take us to yon castle?"
Leela," Rock it, Bender!"
Bender, What was the first one again?
Fry," Well, alright. You sure I probably won't know him?"
Bender," Foul dragon, meet thy doom."
Amy, You-You trashed my party board?
Hermes, Twelve straight hours of limbo. I haven't done that since my honeymoon.
Fry, When will that be?
Bender," You mean Space-tax-achusetts. No chance, stretch pants! We're gonna fight to legalize it right here!"
Leela, He's the most decorated captain in the whole Democratic Order of Planets.
Zoidberg," Yeah, but did you ever play Jenga? Sometimes, you pull one and—"
Leela," Crisis averted. Without alcohol, the Benders are dying off!"
Bender, The explosion?
Zoidberg," Dr. Zoidberg, soaking in brine."
Farnsworth, This is quite a large ranch you have.
Zoidberg," Alright, anteater number one, who are you protecting? Is it anteater number two? Don't stick your tongue out at me. I need a name! What? How do you spell that?"
Farnsworth, The Revolution? 1776 and wot all?
Fry," Woah, gross. Million follower gross."
Zoidberg, Screw you!
Bender, Nailed it!
Leela," Cursed, got it."
Bender," 'Cause he destroyed your business, your home and all your possessions."
Fry, Eck!
Leela," Why not? It's clever, it's unexpected."
Leela, I'm already looking for apartments.
Leela, What about that bathroom egg salad from the truck stop?
Bender," Yeah, it will. Shut up! We'll run off, after I win the Universal Poker Championship! One entry, please."
Bender," And we could call it ""Bend-Aid"", after me, Bender!"
Hermes," I still got the moves! Zoidberg, lower the door another inch."
Bender, I'm too scared.
Farnsworth, It's working! Hooray! I can't hold on!
Bender, You humans and your fragile organs. One little stab to the goo and
Farnsworth," If by that you mean ""transporting cargo"" then yes. It's a little home business I started to fund my research."
Fry, Can you translate it?
Hermes," These security tapes record everything at Planet Express. Including the ship, shower, and urinals."
Leela, What a thoughtful and considerate thing to say.  What the hell's wrong with you?
Fry," Ah, come on. Bender loves mobs."
Fry, Is it dangerous?
Leela, Like a prom dress made from carpet remnants.
Bender, I hate the people who love me and they hate me.
Leela, It says this part of The Hustle implores the gods to grant a favour. Usually a Trans-AM.
Amy, You mean the incurable disease that causes fever... Spasms... Insanity... Coma... And finally death?!
Farnsworth, You're ugly!
Fry, Uh-huh. But is there anything useful we can do?
Fry, It's Mr. Peppy! I'd know 'im anywhere.
Farnsworth," I never said he had hair! If you chose to imagine 'im that way, that's your business. Anyway..."
Leela, Hello? New boots!
Leela," Yeah, sorry, I wasn't really concentrating."
Hermes, Great cow of Moscow!
Bender, And we can use this machine gun to shoot them! Yee-haw! That was fun!
Fry, Is anything not a robot?
Leela, Put your hands in the air!
Bender, What? That's the last straw!
Leela," You can count on us, Professor. We'll get that monument here in time."
Bender, Woo-hoo!
Leela," Thanks. Hi, everybody."
Bender," Shut up and hoot. Hubba-hubba, she is built -- in Mexico, I believe."
Amy," Aye, aye, Captain! I mean only one eye. I mean, yes, sir-- Um, ma'am!"
Bender, Yeah!
Bender," All right, I'll go. But so help me, I'll hold a grudge against every last one of you for the rest of your lives."
Bender," Guys, I swear those are prescription. I need 'em for reading stuff ... on the other side of stuff."
Bender," Man, Father Time really took a bat to this place."
Leela, Excuse me? We're from the Planet Express delivery company. We're here to deliver a robot.
Farnsworth, Time to prune the family tree! Huzzah! I've saved the Farnsworth name!
Hermes," Addition never solve anything, man. Let's cut our losses and go home."
Fry, Unh!!
Fry, But how do I know what to lick and what not to lick?
Farnsworth," That proves nothing. And furthermore, you'd think I'd remember a thing like that. Plus, who are you anyway?"
Zoidberg, Hooray!
Leela, Yah!
Amy," You're right, Professor. We would like to know."
Fry, My card!
Amy," RJ, this is my boyfriend, Kif."
Bender," Let me put it like this. After I leave here, I'm getting a memory enema."
Leela, Good riddance.
Bender," Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, uh-huh, uh-huh Well, Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride, Blah, blah, blah, something, Bender is great! Froggy went a-courtin' and Bender is great, uh-huh--"
Farnsworth," Egg salad? Hmm. Zoidberg will have to examine your gastrointestinal tract. Come, everyone. Give Fry some privacy."
Fry," Attention, New New Yorkers. Stop acting so stupid!"
Fry, That was pretty cool. I think I'm actually starting to get interested in politics.
Zoidberg, You won a Tony. Feh!
Leela, What are you looking at? Is it the eye?
Bender," Oh, can't I?"
Leela, You're here to break us out? But you're the one who put us in.
Farnsworth," Hmm, I know that's a rip but I'll pay for the convenience. Do you take credit cards?"
Bender, You should see me at funerals.
Farnsworth," Leonardo, stop! I want in on this!"
Hermes, And the winner of the war is... let me just cross check my tabulation here. Factor in the corsages for the widows.
Hermes," Yes, yes. Now here's your pension statement. It's empty because you haven't paid into it, you dumb stinkbug!"
Farnsworth, Saving a race of one-eyed monsters? Who could object to that?
Farnsworth," Unless we quickly exterminate them, they'll replicate ad infinitum and consume all the matter on Earth. According to my calculations, there are eleven generations at the moment. That's 2046 total Benders we need to destroy."
Amy," Francis, would you do the honours?"
Amy, Guh! It's the happiest place orbiting Earth.
Zoidberg," So, you wanna come in maybe? I've got a nice pound cake with a footprint on it."
Leela, Prepare for lift-off. Ten.
Fry, I can sort of dance like a robot. Will that help?
Farnsworth, The landlord says your rent is late.
Farnsworth, Which is why we'll all be counting on you and you alone to nurse us through this catastrophe.
Fry, What? I've seen you get up off your back tons of times.
Fry," What's with the specs, Bender?"
Bender," Hey, what the hell are you doing with my head?"
Leela," Hi, Fry.  Did you know these eyePhones are phones, too?"
Leela, Bender!
Leela, My God! This isn't a crap mine. It's a crap farm.
Fry, I just think we should start seeing other people.
Bender, Hold the elevator!
Bender," I dunno exactly, but... I'm incontinent."
Zoidberg, Mazel tov!
Farnsworth," It seems the Youthasizing tar was saturated with time-altering Chronitons. A thin layer is still stuck to our DNA as well as Bender's robo, or ""RNA""."
Leela, Until then...
Bender," I'm back, baby."
Farnsworth," Very distant. Not a true Farnsworth, mind you. He's way over here on this filthy branch riddled with fungus and dung beetles."
Fry, Can someone open a window? It's getting a little warm in here.
Leela, I'm not deaf. I just have to wear this stupid eye patch. Does it look stupid?
Bender," Oh, Elzar, everything's so good!"
Farnsworth," Faster, faster. Slower."
Farnsworth," Dr. Zoidberg, this is Fry, the new delivery boy. He needs a physical."
Farnsworth, I don't have an Uncle Fry.
Farnsworth, No! Could you drag me by the restroom?
Bender," It's one of my ten desert island discs. I never really thought I'd get to use them. But look at me now. Ooh, yeah, baby! Do that thang!"
Bender, My antenna!
Zoidberg," Fry, look what you did, she won't shut up."
Bender," Well I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes, Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes, Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun, Oh, I'll shoot her with my ray gun, Yes, I'll shoot her with my ray gun when she comes, When she comes! I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world, I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world,  I'll be blastin' all the humans,  I'll be blastin' all the humans,  I'll be blastin' all the humans in the world, In the world!"
Bender, Happy birthday!
Bender, And I'll let you sing backup! But remember who the star is. Me  Bender.
Farnsworth," Oh, Lordy Lou, there he goes again. Well, let's give baby what he wants. What if Bender were human?"
Bender," Come on, Lasty!"
Fry," Wow! An old-fashioned mosh pit! Come on, guys. Tonight we're gonna party like its 1999 ... again."
Zoidberg, Are you coming onto me?
Bender, That's a human.
Leela, Mammal.
Leela," Yes. My parents were so hurt, I couldn't help it! But I distinctly told them not to tell anyone."
Fry, You remind me of my old friend Bender.
Fry, It's every man for himself.
Bender," Aww, thanks! You do know I made Robanukah up to get out of work right?"
Farnsworth," Good work, everyone."
Bender," Uh... Men, five. Women, less."
Bender," Worshippers? This ought to liven up my endless, tragic voyage."
Bender, Leela!
Leela," Well, I may not have a man, but at least I've got you, poopsie-doodle."
Bender, Oh!
Leela," It's okay to cry, Amy. Come here, I'm wearing absorbent shoulder straps."
Farnsworth," Please, Leela. Who ever heard of a plane with a woman president?"
Bender, Not good enough!
Leela," I'm not impressed by a guy's message, Fry, I'm impressed by the guy. Or not."
Bender," I know not of this Bender. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood."
Fry, Jamaican? I thought you were some kinda outer-space potato man.
Bender, It is if you're a laser printer.
Fry," Oh, yeah? Well, listen to this  I'm leaving you."
Bender," And being self-reliant. (talking) Hey, I'm pretty good!"
Farnsworth, Get plenty of that powder. I want this bomb to sparkle like the floor at Grand Central Station. Over and out.
Farnsworth," Help! I'm still in mid-peril, you clods!"
Leela," Zoidberg... I'm sorry to break it to you this way, but we hate you and we never wanna see you again."
Amy, Like the heaps of dead monkeys?
Leela," Alright, enough lipstick. Let's storm out."
Fry, Who are you monsters? Is one of you Icy Wiener?
Farnsworth," Oh, boo-hoo! Everyone, look at my latest invention."
Fry," Ah, forget it then."
Leela," Alright. Now there's no way to stop this marriage without hurting Calculon. But he's an actor. If there's one kind of pain he can handle, it's soap opera pain."
Zoidberg, I can't make it! Go on without me!
Farnsworth, If only he had joined a mainstream religion like Oprah-ism or Voodoo.
Hermes," That's statistically impossible. In 77 innings you haven't gotten a single out. At this rate, you're sure to go down as the worst blernsball player of all time."
Leela, Downplay the tiara.
Fry," Yep. It was just a matter of knowing the secret of all TV shows  At the end of the episode, everything's always right back to normal."
Fry," I know. I miss you so much, Leela, even more than when you were here."
Bender," Don't stop now, you'll need some pants to go with that outfit."
Bender, Xmas Eve; another pointless day where I accomplish nothing.
Fry, I like to relax with a spinach martini.
Bender," What? My dinner killed you? Oh, man!"
Fry," Yeah, I get that a lot."
Leela," That's it! I'm never helping you again! If anyone except you needs me, I'll be in the ship."
Zoidberg, Yes.
Leela, One.
Farnsworth, What's all the hubbub?
Farnsworth," Yes, good thing I got us out of that one!"
Bender, Wot in bloody 'ell's goin' on aroun' 'ere ah says?
Fry, I can't wait that long! I've got ADD!
Leela," Well, at least it'll help reduce their population."
Fry, I could stuff myself.
Fry," Yuck, I touched my own butt."
Bender, Hurry! Hurry! Pharaoh's coming! Get that nose in place. Come on!
Zoidberg, Me next!
Leela, Are you alright?
Fry, Yep.
Fry," What Bender means is, you're really brave, and smart, and beautiful, and a great friend."
Bender," What now, chief?"
Bender, Yep. Stolen Pez anyone?
Farnsworth," You wanged my ship, you walnut-panelled idiot!"
Fry, Then dump his one-eyed ass.
Bender," I'd only met the defendant, Fry, once, but I knew he was up to no good."
Fry, I like it!
Fry," Bender, be honest with me. Are you planning a big heist?"
Zoidberg," I thought you were happy, your tail is wagging."
Leela, Time for the drum solo!
Hermes, I have no idea.
Farnsworth, There'll be no further nasty. We still have the option of resorting to violence.
Farnsworth," Yes! For God's sakes, yes!"
Fry, American Express?
Leela," Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out of this if you're willing to let me help you."
Amy, I'm OK.
Fry," I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the Pope?"
Leela, Amy? Where'd she learn to operate the controls like that?
Farnsworth," As a professor of science, I assure you that we did, in fact, evolve from filthy monkey-men."
Leela, Typical 20th century attitude.
Farnsworth," By God, you're right! I'm going to build that Smellescope!"
Fry," Uh, what if that thing I said?"
Fry, Wanna make Shrinky Dinks?
Bender, He's in a better place now.
Fry, One jillion dollars.
Leela, At least it's got a great view.
Leela, What is it? Is Fry alive in some other dimension or something?
Leela," What you did to Guenter was cruel. At the risk of sounding like an after-school special, I think we learned who the real animal was today."
Bender," Hey, Professor, now that the Earth's orbit is further from the sun, won't that make the year longer?"
Leela, I'm worried about him. He didn't come back with the group.
Leela, Idiot.
Fry, So will Seymour remember how to sing Walking On Sunshine?
Fry, Psst! Bender!
Hermes," Curse that Dr. Zoidberg! If I get out of here, he'll be looking down the business-end of a shrimp fork."
Bender," Oh. Alright, yeah! Alright, yeah!"
Leela, Hey! You can't feel sorry for me! I'm a space captain and you're a bunch of losers.
Leela," Previously, on Futurama."
Hermes," Don't worry, boys. I'm sure his father is a perfectly normal, reasonable man."
Amy, Who could have done this?
Farnsworth," Uh, whaa..."
Bender, That poor turtle!
Fry, Maybe he has a parasite.
Fry, Hey! [He yelps as he's constantly swung out of harm's way.
Fry," I don't get it, Michelle. The last time I saw you, you were doing great. You had just dumped me and you were well on your way to getting you life back on track. Why'd you freeze yourself?"
Bender, Then maybe you should act better.
Zoidberg," Cubert,  I felt we needed some father-son bonding time, so I found a couple of  baseball gloves and boiled them up for lunch."
Bender, Cheese it!
Amy," Man, we're way drunk. What happened, Professor?"
Leela, Anything else?
Leela, Amy!
Bender, This is from the league of you-don't-need-to-know.
Farnsworth, Watch for any subtle irregularity in Fry's bowel.
Fry, But I can't play anymore.
Fry," 'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like how you should accept people, whether they be black, white, Klingon or even female. But most importantly, when I didn't have any friends, it made me feel like maybe I did."
Fry, Sure. I'm listed in the phone book so once I reveal my real name to you along with my home address and a copy of my birth certificate--
Leela, It's traditional. Just like aluminium bats and the seventh inning grope.
Bender, What about in the gutter?
Bender," Yeah, the game of Old Maid."
Fry, I have an idea for a sitcom.
Bender," Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?"
Bender, No. But what do you make of this?
Amy, Of course.
Leela," It's kind of a baby book. But OK. Let's see. Snow White Dwarf And The Seven Red Dwarves, Charlotte's Tholian Web, The Fountain Of Aging."
Bender," Uh, wasn't me!"
Bender," Oh, great. Now you tell me!"
Fry," Hm, Spider, Hubble, Nitrogum ... ooh, Big Pink! It's the only gum with the breath-freshening power of ham."
Fry, He's so proud of his awful cooking. If we don't eat it he'll be crushed.
Bender," You know, like how I live every day."
Leela," Uh, hey, why the hell would I? We're all guys here. Sweaty, hairy, gassy guys."
Farnsworth, Probably! It's one o' the symptoms of Tritonian hypermalaria!
Leela," Alright, alright. I'll call him. I mean, if living is that important to you."
Leela," Bender, quit giving the slave drivers pointers!"
Bender," We could have another one, if it would make you guys feel better."
Bender," Oh, you didn't understand? Well let me explain. You ... ... were having sex with you."
Farnsworth," Oh, Lordy Lou! Help!"
Farnsworth, Just 2045 more to go!
Fry, This is great! I haven't had time off since I was 21 through 24.
Bender, Huh? Wasn't me. Must be some of that urine your all so proud of.
Amy," Like us, they speak by dancing."
Leela, Nobody panic! Just get to the panic room!
Leela, Sandstorm! We're in the eye of the storm!
Fry," Maybe Yivo was right. Maybe I should look for love closer to home. I don't know, Leela, you think maybe..."
Hermes, I feel dirty.
Leela," That's you, Professor."
Bender," I'm 40% dolomite! Oh, it's hot! It's very hot!"
Fry," Oh, that reminds me.  It's time to twit my hourly twupdate.  'Sup, followers?  Fry here. Burpin' eggs. Scratchin' my underarm fungus.  Lookin' for love.  Send."
Hermes," Came and went! You're now the proud owner of Bamboo Boogie Boots. With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun."
Amy, Spluh! She's going to go back to her first husband.
Fry," That's normal. Just nod your head and say ""Uh-huh""."
Leela, That's not really a question.
Fry, Is that an invitation?
Bender," I don't know, Fry. For the first time in my life I feel like I've stolen enough."
Amy, You can't stay out on Xmas Eve. You'll be killed!
Farnsworth," Quiet, you. I'm installing an empathy chip."
Fry, Cool effect!
Leela," If it's so dangerous, I'd better go with you. A gal has to protect her DNA."
Leela," I know. I know. Look, Ship, if there's one thing I learned from my mutual break-up with Sean that was totally mutual, it's that happiness can only come from within you."
Leela," No, you don't understand. Lars is the only man I'll ever love. I know it in my heart."
Bender," Good point, Bender."
Fry," With pleasure. Once, not far from here, four people set out on a cattle drive--"
Farnsworth, I'm sure I don't need to explain that all dark matter in the universe is linked in the form of a single non-local meta-particle.
Hermes, Quiet!
Fry," Hey, I'm proud of you, Bender. Avoiding sin for almost a full minute.  Bender?"
Fry, That sounds like me but I thought I got frozen. Wasn't I in the future?
Fry, Pretty good. You?
Leela," Bender, you didn't have to come down here."
Fry, And you got a cage for the lion!
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Today marks our dear friend Dr. Zoidberg's 10th year with Planet Express. Huzzahs are in order."
Leela, Why?
Bender, Word!
Leela, Oh. So you're so shallow that my body disgusts you if it puts on a little extra weight?
Fry, It doesn't look so shiny to me.
Leela, Career chips. You remember? They assign you the job you're best at. I tried to give you one and you ran away. It's how we met!
Hermes, Kill-check one is go!
Hermes," Anyway, my work is done. I'm gonna hit the showers."
Fry, What words? Star Trek?
Fry," Just polishing your shoes, Mr. W."
Amy, Fry?
Hermes, Are you mad? Without machines who will feed us and clothe us and compose our smooth jazz?
Leela, No.
Bender, I can't move.
Bender, Huh? Wha? You say something?
Farnsworth," Eh, wha?! Oh! My... Heart!"
Zoidberg," I've got just the thing  Genuine miracle cream I bought from a travelling salesman. ""Come one, come all,"" he said. ""Step right up!"" ""This sounds too good to be true,"" I thought. He said I looked like a smart, young man. ""So is it a deal?"" I enquired. Two hours later he was gone, with 60 of my dollars. But I have the miracle cream--"
Fry," Amy, you won't believe what happened ... ... it was so scary that you wouldn't-- I know, but listen, it gets even scarier."
Fry," Ah, never mind!"
Leela, Hooray!
Leela, Have you seen this robot?
Farnsworth, Yes. Do what you young people do to unwind. Take a joyride in your jalopy. Wear a T-shirt and eat a fish stick. Go!
Leela," Okay, I'm a freak with a singing butt boil, but I'm still a human being more or less."
Zoidberg, What the hell are you doing?!
Bender, Come out and groom my mangy fur!
Fry," It's funny, Bender; with you sick and Leela blind, only I know what really went on out there. Maybe someday I'll tell you the whole story."
Farnsworth," I've devised a way to save you and stop global warming at the same time. Granted, you're all blasting out greenhouse gases--"
Leela, An' a small whisky. Large.
Farnsworth," Wha, wha?! We thought we were so smart with our science and dancing, but look at us now  At Gigatron's mercy!"
Zoidberg," I just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense."
Fry," I don't think so. 'Cause, as vice chairman of the company, I gain voting control of his shares."
Bender, I locked down the exits but he may have already gotten away.
Fry," Jeez, we're already planning to spend Valentine's Day together. Isn't that enough?"
Zoidberg," Still, a Parcheesi tournament."
Fry, Welcome!
Fry, But I just downloaded her because I love you.
Farnsworth," I love you, Mom. Let's grow ancient together."
Leela, Sorry. I went to my quiet place to write. Here's the script.
Amy," Don't feel sad, my little tadpole."
Amy, Yikes!
Fry, I know Big Vinnie said he was giving me the kiss of death but I still think he was gay.
Fry," Man, it's hot! How hot is it? It's so hot, I poured McDonald's coffee in my lap to cool off. Johnny Carson said it."
Leela," I can hear! I can hear like a safecracker! Hey, aren't you gonna take my hand?"
Farnsworth, No! It's cheaper just to have you die.
Fry," Why'd you bonk me, you idiot? You could have just asked me to come with you. And where are we? This doesn't look like your regular dumpster."
Fry, Yee-haw!
Fry," Leela, I had worms. I needed to know who you loved. Me or them."
Bender, Faster! Faster!
Farnsworth, Commence purity chant.
Zoidberg," You, a bobsledder? That I'd like to see!"
Fry, Then what if we shared a sleigh ride across the ice fields of Hyperion?
Leela," What do you mean ""a scam""?"
Leela," OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
Bender, I think I know where to get some.
Fry," What is it, Professor?"
Bender," What are you, blind? It looks more like a hole full of fried prawns."
Fry, The stinger went right through me and you got all the poison. My new spleen came from a guy who liked to motorcycle.
Fry," Thanks, Leela, but I have no choice. I can't let my monstruous deboner get anywhere near you."
Leela, Sounds nice.
Bender," Hey, I'm gonna try that! So long, meatbags! Son of a—"
Leela, You could've moved this grub-infested log anytime you wanted?!
Bender, Me too. I'll need a butler.
Fry," And then, and then, this giant tapeworm tried to play us for chumps but we like totally dissed Moose!"
Fry, Look! There's Macaulay Culkon.
Zoidberg," She's a hateful monster, this Morgan. She scolded and hit me. I tell you, she's risking my friendship with her."
Bender, I'm boned.
Bender," Here we go, y'all!"
Leela," Yeah, it's weird; Sean was uneducated, unambitious. He was pastey and hunched--"
Bender, Let me go.
Bender, What?
Leela, We're going home. Call us a space taxi.
Bender," Now you know why I use the qualifier, ""practically""."
Leela, Try to stay with the crowd so no one notices how crummy you look.
Leela," Wait, what's that sound?"
Fry, Leela! No means no!
Fry," Leela, you may have become a Lady Gaga-esque fame hag, but you sure cheered up those orphans. Nice job."
Leela, For your looks? Nice one.
Fry, Well I'm gonna take action. It's time to check on my retirement fund. Damn! Still only $100.
Zoidberg," In fact, that's why we loved you."
Bender," Oh, God! Shield your eyes! It's like Edward James Olmos on IMAX."
Fry, Let's go check it out. You can see how I lived before I met you.
Fry," Yes, I am. I simply haven't discovered my primary function yet."
Bender, The other place had a lot of good things too. Did you even see that mountain of skulls?
Bender," What? Don't be stupid, of course not. It just hasn't descended yet."
Leela, Now it's true we'll all miss Fry.
Hermes," Sweet coincidence of Port-au-Prince, we're back at Earth!"
Fry, I'm good at keeping nutcases.
Fry," C'mon, Leela, you deserve better than this guy. Dump him already!"
Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can't censor me just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad role model."
Fry, Uh...
Amy," I've never seen pearls like this. Dr. Zoidberg, you're amazing."
Bender, It's not small?
Bender," Thanks, Calculon. Can I have your autograph?"
Amy, Don't worry. I left a trail of bread crumbs.
Farnsworth, A mysterious world in the darkest depths of the Forbidden Zone.
Leela," Yeah ... what? Look, never mind the words. Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor, honey."
Hermes, I'm going to jump!
Fry, Sure. We talk about it all the time.
Bender, Admit it. You all think robots are machines built by humans to make their lives easier.
Bender, What? Drinking wine is a sin. Even if it is deliciously fortified.
Fry, We're not listening!
Farnsworth," You people are as loud as you are ignorant. Now, get back on your turnip trucks and go home!"
Fry, Bender!
Bender, He's a saint!
Farnsworth," Oh, well, it took almost two hours, but it's finished. Now let's go... to sleep. It's solar powered, so we can't take off until sunrise."
Fry, Pfff! I'm not gonna wind up a loser like that guy.
Bender," Brothers and sisters, let us pry."
Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions of years to evolve into mermaids?"
Farnsworth, Zoidberg? What the hell were you doing in there?
Bender, Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks on the robot calendar.
Bender," Oop! Low on power. Better fuel up! Oh, no! Guess I'll do what I always do when I run out of booze."
Bender, I'm sick of parallel Bender lording his cowboy hat over me! Let's move on to Fry's next fantasy.
Leela," Sorry. I think I, um, I think I left my toaster on."
Hermes, That the way I bird dog best.
Farnsworth," And now that I've nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me away."
Farnsworth," Good news, multiplayers! After a lifetime of toil, I'm on the verge of solving all the mysteries of science!"
Fry," It's my brother, Yancy! And there, in his lapel, my seven-leaf clover! I knew he stole it."
Fry, That's it?
Bender," Man, this is great! I always wanted to nail a dame in a fur coat, and now's my chance. I mean, if you'll introduce me to one, sir. (To Fanny ) One as sexy as you, baby! Bender out."
Amy," Professor Katz, we want answers!"
Bender, Check.
Leela, Look at that statue. It's only got one eye.
Leela," Enough with the feelings, you two. If we're gonna cure Bender we've got to go back to the castle and hunt down the original were-car."
Bender, I only need one.
Leela, Come on. We've gotta find some way to talk to him.
Bender, Hmm. It should look like this. But instead it looks like this.
Leela," Dad, you're being too lenient again! I have to be back by 11."
Leela, I don't know.
Leela, You'll never pardon anybody because you'll never get elected president. The voters of Earth aren't the pea-brained idiots they were back in your time.
Fry, Yup. We call them land-sealions ... I tame them!
Farnsworth, All these trees are robotic. I can't believe how quickly they sprung up.
Amy, Buh!
Zoidberg, This is a witch hunt!
Bender, Fry! My skin!
Bender," Yeah, I guess so. But I don't see why we keep this ticking time-bomb around just for that dumb animal."
Bender," Hm. I forgot you could tempt me with things I want. Well, I suppose I've always wondered what it would be like to be more annoying."
Leela," What the hell are we doing? We're all gonna die so this ""junkyard Golem"" can celebrate Robanukah."
Bender, For Slurms!
Leela," Fry, this is for you."
Fry," No, Amy!"
Fry, Ow! My head! Ow! My feet! Ow! My head! Ow! My feet!
Fry," I don't know. This place is great and all but its just so artificial. The gravity, the air, the gophers. You might as well stay on Earth. That's what I came to see! I wanna go out there and jump around like an astronaut. Screw this phoney stuff!"
Bender, Hooray!
Amy," Hey, handsome. Is there room in there for two?"
Leela," Please, is it about the fate of our people? Because I'm very interested in that."
Farnsworth, We can't trust a woman's math! Count again!
Leela," This is it. We'll just run in, grab Bender's disk and run out. Got it?"
Bender," Ah, Leela's experiencing the greatest joy a woman can feel  Worshipping some low-life jerk."
Farnsworth, You're all fired.
Bender," Hello? Imperial Dragon Restaurant? I've got a herd of you-know-whats for sale. Let me check. Oh, aren't you a cutie? About 35lbs. What?"
Leela, Talk to me.
Leela," Oh, back off, missy!"
Bender," Yeah, but it's on my body. What am I gonna do?"
Fry, Pft! Like anyone on Earth cares.
Zoidberg," Finally, some respect."
Leela," It worked! Gravity normal, air returning. Terror replaced by cautious optimism! We did it, Fry! Fry? You gave me your oxygen? Oh, no! Breathe, Fry! Breathe! You leave me breathless. Happy Valentine's Day, Fry."
Hermes, Practically no one. All in favour of me?
Amy, What's it made of?
Fry," I guess I'm happy for 'im. And, honestly, Francis is a way better friend than Bender ever was. Hey, where is Francis?"
Fry, Look out! He's got a gun!
Amy," Um, Leela? Armando and I are going to the back seat of his car for coffee. You gonna be alright here by yourself?"
Leela, The only kind of crawling I'm doing to you is away ... from!
Zoidberg," No, I mean 40 pounds!"
Leela," Yivo talks a lot about love, but what he's actually doing..."
Leela, Let me give you a hand.
Fry, I don't feel well.
Leela," Oh, my God! He ate Fry! Fry is dead!"
Farnsworth," Zoidberg, show some respect! This is a sacred shrine to the thousands who lost their lives."
Farnsworth, I can't believe the devil is so unforgiving.
Bender," Hey, yeah!"
Fry," Pardon me, excuse me."
Zoidberg, That's what I'm talking about!
Leela," They planted traditional college foliage; ivy, trees, hemp. Soon the whole planet was terraformed."
Leela, Brace for emergency landing!
Bender, Hamburger!
Leela, Sorry about that. I guess I needed a few more warm-up pitches.
Bender," Ah, let's face it  Comedy's a dead art form. Now, tragedy... That's funny!"
Zoidberg, Woob.
Leela, It's very nice. We should get a picture before the tide comes in.
Leela, Wait! You mean he's still out? His life's in danger!
Hermes," They say the world looks down on the bureaucrats, They say we're anal, compulsive and weird, But when push comes to shove, You gotta do what you love, Even if it's not a good idea. Zoidberg!"
Bender, Guys! Guys! There's something on television.
Farnsworth," And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I too hope one day to go  The toilet."
Zoidberg, Basically.
Hermes, We're just so busy.
Bender, Watch it!
Leela," Well, your motives were good.  And we were both loopy from dehydration. Hey, wait!  You've been doing an awful lot of urinating!"
Leela, I found a satellite!
Fry, Uh-huh.
Zoidberg, I hope you picked up some Scotch tape while you were there.
Bender," Yep. It's like I taught 'em  If it ain't black and white, peck scratch and bite! Now to take off my tuxedo. Guys, it's me! Your lovable dictator! Uh-oh!"
Hermes," Exciting news, people! The pet licence I requisitioned for Nibbler has arrived."
Leela, How did we manage to survive? What gave us those strange powers?
Leela, But he gave me his jacket. Look.
Fry, I though that maybe if you heard a familiar voice it might help keep your mind together. But who knows if it really got through.
Zoidberg, I'll save us! By scaring 'im off with my crazy war noise! Crunch all you want. I'll make more.
Leela," What's your problem, Holmes? Now we'll be stuck like this forever!"
Farnsworth, I'm bored! Let's go!
Bender," Hey, check out the palm tree! It only gets sick when I cook brunch! How's that for a coincidence, Professor? With all your precious science!"
Fry," Uh, what?"
Fry," I'm almost there, Leela."
Leela," Uh, couldn't make that out. Too much static."
Leela, You mean... When you disappeared up on the comet...
Bender," Goodbye, cruel me! I learned that from a movie."
Fry," DNA and career chip, please."
Bender," Yes, I do."
Fry, You take that back! She does not look good for a truck stop chick!
Amy," Oh, no problem."
Hermes," Surely, your heart shell is too rigid! I call on anyone but you to do the peace dance!"
Zoidberg," Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy! Freedom, freedom, freedom, oy!"
Farnsworth, One bowl of mild farina.
Fry," Uh, no, no, that's alright. Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!"
Fry," Friendship, then I'll sell Planet Express, for you."
Farnsworth, Shut up!
Zoidberg, Super bad. It's Tritonian hypermalaria. A lot of these men will be dead within twenty-four hours.
Leela," Nightfall's coming. Hurry, before we freeze."
Fry, I've got to do something to show Leela how sorry I am.
Hermes," The information we need will be here, in the physical files."
Leela, But they're not even sharp. Who could I possibly hurt with them?
Bender," Wooo! I totally killed him. Oh god, what have I done?"
Bender," I support and oppose many things, but not strongly enough to pick up a pen."
Amy, That's what we said about Zoidberg and look what that got us.
Bender, Like how? Having my antenna removed?
Amy," This calls for a celebration! Come on, everyone! Let's go tanning!"
Fry," Oh, hey, everyone, this is Colleen."
Fry, Finally!
Leela," We call it a ""video game""."
Farnsworth, Not if you'll grant me the same liberty.
Leela," Fry, you're wasting your life sitting in front of that TV. You need to get out and see the real world."
Fry," Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's bigger than anything you've caught. Ow! My small intestine!"
Leela, She's gaining on us.
Fry," Hey, Leela. I'm some French guy."
Bender," Thank you, thank you. And if you enjoyed that diatribe then you'll want to purchase my spoken word album, just 18.95! Act now and you'll get this Bender action figurine."
Fry," Bender, if you don't open that can right now, your fear will own you, and nothing that can opener could ever do would be worse than that."
Fry, Yeah. Either that or be a man.
Fry," Oh, yeah."
Leela," Oh, lots of reasons."
Leela, Aww! Somebody likes snouts.
Fry," Oh, can't you leave me alone? I'm miserable enough already."
Fry, I'll have the Stroganoff.
Bender, That's for sure. Not on the measly salary I steal from you each month.
Fry, Try and stop me!
Amy, Uh-oh!
Farnsworth," Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why? Why? Why didn't I break his legs?"
Leela, Yeah!
Farnsworth," Here you go, my friend. 5000 Professor Land fun bucks."
Fry," Here's the two-hundred feet of rope you ordered, Sheriff Burley."
Leela," Well, those arguments aside, we're still going."
Leela, Which way to your house? The sign says we're at 71st Street.
Bender, Stop tempting me! For once in my life I have inner peace.
Fry, Cool! Just like in Star Trek! Ow!
Bender, They're my lucky shades. I stole them off some lucky guy while his lucky seeing eye dog was taking a whiz.
Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes. But not this year, because my latest invention is unbeatable. Behold! The death clock. Simply jam your finger in the hole and this read-out tells you exactly how long you have left to live."
Bender," Aye! We're hitched up tighter than Davy Jones' U-Haul! At ease, men."
Leela, Wait! I can explain.
Leela, It doesn't look anything like me. The hair is all wrong.
Leela, No. But theirs are!
Fry, I 'unno.
Leela, Prepare for launch.
Fry, That's the secret ingredient of Slurm?
Fry," Oh, yeah!"
Bender, I'm not sure. But I do know that she likes my in-your-face attitude.
Bender, Yes! Take her first.
Leela," Well, here goes."
Bender," Hey, I should be mad at you! Now turn around."
Amy, Ew! I'm all licky-sticky!
Fry, Wuh— What happened?
Zoidberg, Me! Me! Choose Zoidberg.
Leela," No, you're disgusted by me!"
Farnsworth, We're saved!
Zoidberg," No, it's a fabulous, crab-ulous day!"
Leela, What the hell were you doing? I warned you to stay away from those guys.
Fry, But Nibbler heat-blasted it off my butt! I want to stress that part!
Fry, Is the puppy mechanical in any way?
Farnsworth," That's Leonardo DiCaprio, you blockhead!"
Leela, It won't move. And the door release is on the other side.
Zoidberg, A pogo-stick!
Farnsworth," It worked! Eat it, everyone whose never won a Nobel Prize! And that includes you, Amy!"
Leela," Oh, if only we had a toboggan."
Fry," So, Chrissy, we seem to be hitting it off. If you're not doing anything later might I escort you to a kegger?"
Leela," Bender, you can't crash a mob wedding."
Fry," People, I won't let you enter. Popplers are as intelligent as you or me."
Bender, Did you see me?! History came alive an' I killed it!
Bender, No! You can't blow up my monument. I won't be remembered.
Bender," Well, nice talking to you."
Fry, Con't we just go back in time an' set things roight again?
Bender, I don't know. I've got a lot of great memories in my old place. And now they're gone.
Fry," It's him! It's my grandfather, Enos."
Bender," Please, I have some dignity!"
Bender, Almost ready!
Zoidberg," The Magnificent Three. Scene 10, take 95."
Leela, Something's rotten on the planet Wormulon. Look at this.
Amy," You just need to polarize the Earth's core with a huge static charge, by ratcheting Superconducting wire down into... Sorry."
Fry, Tremble? I laugh. Nobody knows more about Star Trek than me!
Bender, Ooh! Ow! Son of a-- Careful with that! Ow...
Leela," Good. This will be my chance to reason with him, captain to captain."
Bender, How should I know?  And how come you never ask if I'm okay?  I'm feelin' a little neglected here!
Fry, No biggie.
Leela," Yes, but what about the animals?"
Bender," Yeah, I'll go."
Farnsworth, Fry?
Bender," Yes! I joined a club I thought was cool, but it turns out all the leaguie-weegies are totally lame. That's what we call ourselves, ""leaguie-weegies."""
Leela," Uh-uh, forget it. A, I'm camera shy; and B, I get tongue tied in front of an audience armed with death rays."
Bender, Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
Fry, Why?
Bender, Is that better?
Leela," Hey, cut it out!"
Leela," May it please the Court... I mean, may it plizzle the cozizzle."
Leela," Hey, Bender, look at that woman's purse. It's hanging by a spaghetti strand."
Leela, You went there this morning for doughnuts.
Leela, I'm going to swim with a whale. They're the gentle giants of the deep.
Hermes," Oh! Wife? What are you doin' with Bender's shiny metal, gas compressor?"
Bender," I got it, I got it! I don't got it!"
Fry, I guess we could do chores for a few hours.
Farnsworth, Something absolutely incredible! The sweaters got folded.
Farnsworth, Please! There's no time for this now. This is an emergency. We must warn the mayor.
Fry, Fine. I'll let go and swim around in the Slurm and drink as much as I want. Help! I can't swim!
Bender, Stupid dumb coma ... coulda been British.
Leela, What if I just helped the two of you find a bigger apartment?
Farnsworth, Ha ha ha! I'll never tell you. It's a deep space-emotion detector. The detector can tell you're impressed. You should be! Wha? The marvellous device. It's detecting a massive burst of anger. From deep space!
Leela, I didn't mean to hit you. I have some trouble with depth perception.
Leela," Oh, no! Hurry, Guenter, climb up the vine. You can still save yourself."
Fry, Give it up!
Farnsworth, A Massachusetts hapenny?
Bender," Correct, Wiggles. You've just earned an invitation to the captain's table"
Fry, Is she alright?
Fry," Yes, sir. Nothing fancy. I'm willing to start at the bottom and infiltrate my way up."
Hermes, We find the defendant vulnerable yet spunky!
Fry, Ahh! It's good to hear his voice!
Leela, Sorry.
Bender," Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?"
Amy," Yay, Hermes!"
Fry," Alright, you gas, what's the deal?"
Farnsworth," Are you ready, Bender?"
Leela, Fry! Stay back. He's too powerful.
Leela," Don't do it, Hermes! You have so much to live for."
Fry, What is the matter with you?
Fry, Pft. A female leader?
Fry, But everyone is driving around in cars shooting at each other.
Bender, Help! Help!
Leela," Oh, not at all. I'm just so, uh, really thrilled to meet you!"
Leela," You will? Eh, what's the point? You'll have to look sooner or later."
Leela, Do you know how long it's going to take me to recalibrate these engines?
Leela, Only a few more. Hey! I won free admission to Six Flags! Just one more reason we must survive this.
Bender," Oh, yeah? Track this motion."
Zoidberg," Your student loans have been repaid? Then how 'bout lending your old pal Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr. Millionaire!"
Leela," Santa's a robot, so we should be able to destroy him with a logical paradox. Bender, you'd better cover your ears."
Leela," There. It was hard work, but it beats posing in demeaning, skimpy modelling outfits."
Leela, I was?
Fry, Then I am the most important person in the universe.
Farnsworth, A toast to Leela. She showed us it's wrong to eat certain things.
Bender, Yep. Nothing in there but all the best music of the 1980's in one amazing collection.
Leela, Alright. Low and away.
Fry, I 'unno. But the analysis showed it was printed on recycled toilet paper. A squeezably soft paper used mainly in the sewers.
Bender, Good thing everyone is freshly bathed and groomed.
Bender, We're in here too.
Bender," And hookers, don't forget hookers."
Farnsworth, Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
Bender," Get lost! I'd say ""Don't quit your day job"" but you're awful at that too."
Fry," There. One million papers, folded and loaded!"
Farnsworth, I'm not interested in the whereabouts of your cutesy-fruitsy space rat. The only thing that matters right now is this crystal.
Farnsworth," The bad news, everyone, is the beast reproduces asexually. A single bone vampire, left alone with some quiet music and some bone-vampire porn, could produce dozens of deadly offspring."
Fry, So now Leela's all crotchety because she thinks I'm not attracted to her in the Professor's body.
Leela, Leela?
Fry, He puts his hat back down.] I fold.
Bender," Oh, Fry, you gotta try this sterno-nicoise!"
Bender," Now, I can explain that."
Farnsworth, Played pelvic pinochle? I'm afraid so.
Bender," You're full of crap, Fry! You make a persuasive argument, Fry."
Leela, Where's that chicken soup we asked for?
Leela," Hey, Fry, I didn't know you had a tattoo of Bender on your ass."
Leela, Where is it?
Fry, But ... I know you in the future. I-I cleaned your poop.
Fry," Whoa, whoa! Slow down. You're going a mile a minute."
Bender," Yeah, Fry already wiped off some of the dirt with his finger."
Amy, Wow! I could swear I was really playing virtual skeeball! Hm?
Bender," You did it, Fry! You found the winning bottle-cap! We won!"
Fry, It's him. He's OK!
Leela," Ooh, look at that!"
Farnsworth," Oh, let's go check on Hermes. All this inspiring multi-culturalism is angrying up my blood. Sweden? I don't think so!"
Fry," Well, you're looking great."
Amy," If you wanna do something, you do it, and to splick with the consequences!"
Fry, Life saving goody goody ...
Fry, What the hell are you talking about?
Fry, I'm not scared of that at all.
Leela, Wha?
Leela, Please.
Amy," That's OK. At least Kif's baby shower should be fun. I'd better put it on my calendar. Thursday  Baby shower, enter. Might as well plan for my new life while I'm at it. Set ""Motherhood Mode""."
Leela," There's nothing so refreshing as the clean, crisp taste of this bold Canadian beer."
Fry, Aww. So you froze yourself to come look for me?
Leela," You know what the best part is? From now on, whenever we're eating fresh, organic space meat, we'll know exactly where it comes from."
Leela," Bender, would you do the honours?"
Bender," That plot makes perfect sense. Wink, wink."
Bender, Ahhh! The old switcheroo.
Fry," Thanks. These aren't pockets, they're just flaps. I put my money in my sock."
Amy," No, don't!"
Fry, We did it! We're the right ages again!
Fry, You'd better stay here during biology. Mrs. Jenkins dissects anything smaller than a fifth grader.
Bender," Oh, crap!"
Hermes, Our electric bill's climbing faster than a green snake up a sugar cane. Obviously someone round been wastin' a whole heap a juice! Probably you!
Farnsworth," Ha ha ha ha! Don't make me laugh. If we fight, we'll surely be destroyed."
Hermes, My manwich!
Farnsworth, Bingo!
Leela, Professor Hubert Farnsworth.
Leela," Well, settle in. Without a microwave we're trapped in this time period."
Amy, Thanks everybody. Looks like I'm back in the game.
Leela, What?
Leela," Those aren't swan boats, they're swans."
Leela," Bender, I thought you were supposed to be cooking for this party."
Bender," Yeah, it is cute."
Leela," For Heaven's Gate, Professor. This ship can do 99% light speed. Why are we going 35 miles an hour?"
Hermes," What's the matter, robot? You got a rod up your spine?"
Fry, What's wrong?
Fry," I know, we'll call them Popplers!"
Fry, What?  Oh.  Okay.
Bender," Ah, yes, John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a cord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree."
Amy," OK, Fry, we're done putting on the bra."
Hermes, I think I'm coming down with circusitis.
Bender," ...I'm telling you, my broken friend..."
Amy, The keys to the ship! They must have fallen into the crate! Leela's gonna kill me!
Bender, You know we don't!
Amy, Ew!
Farnsworth, And they say pure math has no real-world applications!
Leela, The Mona Lisa!
Bender, Holy frijoles!
Fry, Like a balloon and ... something bad happens.
Zoidberg, Aw... I think I'm remembering that thing I forgot.
Leela," If you see any steaks, that'd be good!"
Fry, So now you do wanna marry him?
Zoidberg, Ow!
Fry, You sure you don't wanna kill all Humans?
Amy," My parents may be evil, but at least they're stupid."
Bender," I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood."
Farnsworth, Do I hear wedding bells?
Farnsworth," I got a feeling this could be exactly the point in time we've been looking for. Nope. In fact, all life is extinct."
Leela, I'll have the cholesterol-free omelette with horse beaters.
Bender, I've placed instruments under your seats. Play 'em or I'll break 'em over your heads!
Fry," Uh, Leela?"
Fry," Please, Justice Dogg, Leela and her friends are completely innocent."
Zoidberg," I know that. Surrender your mysteries to Zoidberg! Oh, no! Professor will hit me. But if Zoidberg fixes it, then perhaps gifts! Ow! What? Oh!"
Fry, Give several reasons why.
Leela," Thanks for taking me out, Amy. I feel slightly less miserable already."
Amy, That's it!
Fry," No, she just makes us do work and stuff."
Fry, He's got me beat!
Bender, You killed Fry!
Bender, So how 'bout them Knicks?
Farnsworth, Almost done.
Leela, What?
Fry," Yeah, yeah, I've gotten used cars before."
Amy," Oh, Kif!"
Bender," No, you shut up."
Farnsworth," Ah, Cubert, my precious babe. I'm going to attempt to clone Fry's dog using the very same apparatus I used to clone you. Ooh, look! There's a smidge of toe still in here. You see, beneath the fossil's crunchy, mineral shell, there's still a creamy core of dog nougat."
Amy, Really?
Farnsworth," Don't you understand, you little nitwit? Unless you're treated soon, the only way to restore your true age would be to grow into it! Just as God intended."
Fry, The year ten thousand? But I promised Leela I'll be on time for dinner.
Leela, What's wrong? Did you swallow your phone again?
Leela," Wait a minute! You did it all backwards. Fry's the one who should be-- Oh, never mind!"
Fry, What do we care? We live in the United States.
Leela, I'd like you to reconsider letting us rescue those animals.
Bender, Excuse me.
Bender, Hot diggety!
Hermes, Yes?
Bender," Don't worry, Leela. Soon we'll be able to look back on this and laugh."
Leela, I wish just once Bender could feel exactly what I feel.
Leela, The Earth is under attack. Can't we just forget about that?
Zoidberg," Relax, friends."
Leela," How'd you do, Fry?"
Amy, We know! They shmooped up Manhattan and blasted us toward the Sun!
Bender, Hooray!
Fry, I know. I liked it. I wanna see it again.
Fry, Incredible. This place is just like the Ancient Egypt of my day.
Fry," Hey, aren't you supposed to be eating our brains? You're mutants."
Fry," Sir, if I may, why don't you just set up like a billion video cameras in the woods and see if he walks by one?"
Fry," OK, I'll fight the box. I think I can take him."
Leela," Oh, uh, hey, Fry!"
Amy, Your parents must be so proud. Oops! Sorry.
Amy," Right on, Professor!"
Fry, May yet? Really?
Leela, I already did!
Bender," Shut up, you!"
Fry, I'm gonna continue never washing this cheek again.
Farnsworth," I'm not your grandpa, you're my uncle! From the year 2000!"
Fry, Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.
Leela," He's hooked up to a life-support system. We have to disconnect him very, very carefully, or the shock could kill him."
Fry, Relax! She can't be my grandmother. I figured it all out.
Bender, Your social security cheque is late! Stuff costs more than it used to! Young people use curse words!
Leela," Look! It's a baby queen! Aw, she's so cute! You adorable wittle, itty-bitty, fuzzy-wuzzy--"
Bender, Neat!
Bender, You can brew your own beer?
Fry," That hurt, but I can take it."
Farnsworth," Oh, that's stupid!"
Amy," Scuffed kippers, anyone?"
Leela, Eyesight is for chumps.
Bender, My God! I'm overcome with ... feelings. I'm experiencing a powerful yearning to ... to cram my gullet full of mackerel heads.
Leela, Even if I make you work hard?
Bender, Hooray for the pigs!
Leela," Aw, let's let those kids skate with us."
Amy," Hey, I found a safe!"
Bender, Impossible! I'm triple sealed to prevent any chance of ...
Leela, Very nice. Where'd you steal them?
Zoidberg," Quiet, robot! Bender's on TV."
Leela, This will make a great episode. But talk slower. I can't type that fast.
Leela, Ooh. That feels good.
Bender," Are you familiar with my friend Al Gore? I'm tellin' you, losers get really desperate around Valentine's Day."
Leela, Why don't you come a little closer so my boot can hear you?
Farnsworth," Oh, my, no."
Hermes, Poor Fry! He's got the munchies for freedom!
Leela, Take it off or I'll break it off.
Leela," And this, my friends, is the L-unit I just removed from the ship."
Fry, Married? Jenny can't get married.
Zoidberg," Fry, I know you're upset right now, but I hope you'll consider donating the body to science dinner."
Leela," So after I specifically asked you not to touch anything, you drank a bottle of strange blue liquid? It could have been poisonous acid!"
Leela, No!
Farnsworth," Go, Leela!"
Zoidberg, What?
Bender, Let's go already!
Leela, Are you okay? What just happened?
Bender," Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping but you rarely have to use the phrase ""upside your head""."
Fry, No!
Fry, No! No!
Zoidberg, Hello!
Farnsworth," Oh, did I mention the crippling, agonising pain? I'm pretty sure I did. Oh, yes, definitely."
Fry," Hey, yeah! Maybe it is still there. Underground in the ruins of Old New York, helping some ant defeat another ant or helping some piece of dirt turn its luck around."
Bender," People, it's far, far worse than we thought; my fish got away."
Leela, And bring a baggy in case he drops a steamer. Have a great night!
Fry, Evil Knievel could!
Fry, My nose! Light of my face!
Leela, Feministas unite!
Farnsworth," While I try to restore our normal ages, I expect you all to go about your jobs like responsible professionals."
Bender, You mean a man! It was his Bar Mitzvah.
Bender, Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.
Bender, You really want a robot for a friend?
Bender," Aww, that's sweet boss. Fry'll be nice and cozy back in the year 2000."
Hermes," Where did you requisition this party? And Zoidberg, what are you doing here?"
Fry," It's an honor to meet you, Leonardo. And may I say you were great in Titanic. The Beach? Neh."
Fry, She sure is pretty. You ought to marry her and father some children right away.
Bender, Oh my goodness!
Bender," It takes more than that to surprise me, Bender. What you doin', little buddy? Uh, yeah... Uncle Bender... He's your friend. Huh? Oh, you wanna play fetch! Come on, boy! Get the ball. Dumb jerk. Come on! Get the ball."
Bender, Ah. This place never changes.
Farnsworth, It belonged to my grandmother.
Leela," Thanks for the offer, Professor, but we don't have the proper career chips."
Amy," Hey, that's my watch!"
Leela, But I didn't even limbo.
Fry," Well, at least you can plan accordingly."
Farnsworth," Remember, we've got to show these people we're not bitter husks of human beings who long ago abandoned hope of finding love in this lifetime. Leela, you'll have to do some acting."
Fry," Whatever's in there, it's the only thing I've ever wanted."
Fry, Who are you noisy women?
Fry, Sure!
Leela," Then you'll all work triple shifts, You can make the job go quicker if you turn up the controls to super-speed."
Farnsworth, Initiating controlled infection.
Fry, Will too!
Fry, Aha! Cornered!
Bender, Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone except me to the wall?
Amy, I don't really like coffee.
Zoidberg, Ow.
Farnsworth," Unbelievable. It's a second big bang. My God, is it possible?"
Farnsworth," That calculus lecture was harder than I expected. We had to answer every question in the form of an opera. I have a lot of homework for tomorrow, if I don't want to be Embarrassed!"
Leela, Me and Bender and maybe Zoidberg if he feels like it.
Hermes," Don't be silly, mon. The last ghost died over 200 years ago."
Fry, Eat and sleep.
Bender, That is one sexy bridge abutment.
Leela, Bender! What's going on in here? Planet Express Ship! Cover your shame.
Farnsworth, Absolutely not! I won't speak! I've got nothing to hide!
Farnsworth," Good, good."
Fry," Well, I got my shield for stopping Bender. But then I got fired for tipping off Bender."
Bender, What? Who says I didn't evolve?
Bender, C'mon!
Farnsworth, Duhhh.
Fry, Ow!
Bender, Damnit! We weren't counting on them being as smart as they are sexy!
Fry, Stupid naked aliens. Stupid Lars. I hate the future.
Farnsworth," Oh! Those poor, doomed bastards. I guess it's up to me to complete the mission."
Fry, The Cavern on the Green.
Fry," Maybe it's none o' my business, but, if it were up to me, we'd be on all the time. An' I mean all the time."
Farnsworth," Oh, it's a gem of an evening. I feel so wonderful having someone to take over my life's work. And it's all thanks to Cubert."
Bender, Hooray! It won't go on!
Hermes," No one, except a legendary limbo champion."
Leela, Wrong again.  You were right.
Bender," Malachi, every time I interfere, I only make things worse. You're best off solving your own problems."
Fry," Well, sure. To the extent a man can love a woman. But this seems like a big step."
Fry, Sith? What the Hoth?
Bender, What kind of moronic plan is that? Wow!
Zoidberg, Maybe he's just trying to feed his family.
Fry, So where are the Encyclopods and the Dark Ones now?
Bender," Oh, my life is over. I'll never know happiness again."
Farnsworth," I was just regaling your former co-workers with a tale of bedroom antics, the likes of which--"
Leela, I wonder why Dr. Zoidberg is acting this way. Out of all of us he always seemed the most normal.
Amy, You remember your own birth?
Leela," That poor, incompetent crew. What do you think happened, Professor?"
Fry," That's right. And I think you'll find that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing! OK, better think of a new plan. Come on, Fry, think! Thinking ... thinking..."
Fry," He's so cute! He can do two things at one time  Eat and swim. Ooh, three things!"
Bender, Behold! I have emerged from the place of spells and fairies!
Leela, Huh? Hey! Quit it! Hi-yah!
Leela," Sally, that's wonderful. You came up with that yourself? Out of thin air? How?"
Amy," Oh, my God!"
Leela, Wow! The first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball.
Fry, We don't have a brig.
Leela, Ouch!
Bender, I guess that would be stupid. Never mind.
Leela," Oh, you're all so cute!"
Fry, Now me and Leela are forming an awesome crime-fighting duo.
Fry," We've been had, people. The Monsterpus is a monster perv."
Bender," You know, I like it here. What's the rent on one of these jars?"
Leela, It got the professor!
Leela, Who's ready to kick some sweaty man-butt?
Amy, So?
Leela, I do go! He's a very important man.
Zoidberg, Stop! Stop! If you interrupt the mating dance the male will become enraged and maul us with his fearsome gonad.
Fry, Scientists like you!
Zoidberg," Gracias. Single Female Lawyer, where were you on the night of August 23rd?"
Zoidberg," I'm no doctor, but this machine guy could use a lozenge."
Fry, I gotta go with Bender.
Fry, No.
Zoidberg," Glad you like them. I've been making fine jewellery for years, apparently."
Hermes, Organised!
Bender, That's it. I'm leavin' while I still 'ave my dignity. See you in the obituaries!
Hermes," I can guess. Actually, I can't guess."
Farnsworth, In that case I'll have to hire a new crew to go on our company vacation.
Amy, Looks like we're on the Fiesta Deck.
Leela," Oh, great, Captain Moron has a plan. Why don't you tell it to Wingus and Dingus here?"
Fry, Fry's dog! I will now perform my people's native dance.
Leela, Stop eating Popplers! They can talk!
Farnsworth," We'll need to look our best if we're to get the account of our new potential customer, Romanticorp."
Bender," But, I love you."
Farnsworth, There! The engine modifications are complete.
Fry," Wow, it hasn't changed in a thousand years."
Farnsworth, Quit the show!
Fry, C'mon!
Hermes," Yeah, man! You got to legalize it!"
Bender," Oh, no? I'm 40% lucky. The scrap metal I'm made from included a truckload of horseshoes from the luckiest racehorses in Mexico, who had just been sent to a glue factory."
Leela, Could you maybe pay a little more attention to these asteroids?
Bender, Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! That was close.
Farnsworth, Yay!
Amy," Yeah, and if you were the Pope they'd be all, ""Straighten your Pope hat,"" and, ""Put on your good vestments."" You know, Fry, it's nice to find someone I can talk to about stuff, and junk."
Zoidberg, What?
Leela, You wanna know what it's like to be a mutant? Jump in and go for a swim.
Leela," No, you can't!"
Leela, We better stop Paul Revere before—
Bender, Except Sports by Huey Lewis.
Leela," Yeah, actually. You're doing OK. The core reactor temperature's nominal, the blinker's off."
Fry," Yeah, well, good luck. It'd take some kind of genius to count all those rings."
Leela," Fry, don't die! Wake up! Nooo!"
Hermes, Everybody sing Jamaica!
Leela," Sure thing, Professor!"
Bender," Yeah, and if you won't give me another chance, perhaps you'd give one to ... ... Og, gorilla emperor of Earth!"
Amy, General sluttiness.
Fry," Hurry, Leela! Get some coasters and cold mugs."
Hermes," So there it is, people. Due to budget cutbacks, we will no longer be offering free squid guts in the kitcken."
Bender," We are travellers from the past, my good runt."
Hermes, You leave kitty cat alone!
Bender, Or a guy who burns down the bar for the insurance money.
Leela," Good night, dumb prince."
Leela," Hi, there!"
Bender," Uh, actually you traded it for a bead."
Leela," Big O, little k, my friend! Just checking if everything's alright."
Fry, Ooh!
Hermes," Alas, no. I got the key but not the authority."
Fry, Our what?
Fry, Everyone just calm down and make yourself a tissue walrus.
Zoidberg," Panic, jerks!"
Bender, Yeah! And you'd better get rid of whatever's causing it or we're outta this dump!
Bender," Make Bender take a nap in a tube. Come back when I've had some sleep, baby!"
Zoidberg, Hooray! It's just like Mardis Gras!
Leela," Oh, did my bodily infirmity embarrass you?"
Fry, Who cares? That won't be for hundreds of years.
Zoidberg," Good, cause I'm sick of him!"
Bender, Neat!
Fry, What's this dump?
Farnsworth," I am? That's not good news at all, you little--"
Farnsworth, Balderdash! I never agreed to that!
Hermes," LaBarbara, no!"
Farnsworth, Who wants the machine to show them an alternate reality?
Fry, Good point ... I guess.
Farnsworth," Oh, it must have been the ship's new improved personality software I installed."
Bender," Hey, what about this?"
Fry, And I helped! Wait. You told me it was an unstoppable ice cream machine.
Zoidberg, Hello.
Amy, Look out for the next thing!
Bender, Why? 'Cause I can make annoying noises?
Leela," Thanks, Kif. Very nice work."
Leela," Oh, Lord."
Farnsworth," Commissioner, my crew has made a horrific discovery  It seems that Slurm is produced in a colossal worm hiney!"
Zoidberg, What are you? My driver's license?
Fry, Who's the Zapp Brannigan?
Leela," I wish we could, but our chief slogan writer is back at the Honeybun Hideout."
Fry, It is?
Leela, You're a male and I'm a female.
Hermes, What the hell does that mean?
Bender," It's not ironic, it's just mean. Take this!"
Fry, We don't have long!
Leela," Fry! I'll read your candy later, when we're not dead! What was that?"
Fry, Lars makes me puke. I bet she'd love me too If I was a blad headed kook.
Bender, Ooh! Ooh! Name it after me!
Farnsworth, This is an outrage! I demand you hand over your captain's jacket.
Leela," Hey, what's behind that door?"
Bender, ...Just 'cause I can't jump and dance and sing...
Fry, Wait! I remember this place. They shut it down after all those people caught salmonella from the flume ride.
Bender, Aren't those the particles that destroyed an entire civilisa--
Bender, Right on!
Farnsworth, One might not say that! Your tux doesn't fit because you stole it from a boy!
Fry, There aren't any more. And there never will be.
Farnsworth, Not surprising enough!
Farnsworth," Care to say a few words, Bender?"
Bender," No? OK, I got a lock on him. Yep! He's gay!"
Fry, Okay... That's a good point.
Hermes," We'll start by slashing salaries, and this time I mean really slashing."
Fry, Mom! Help!
Zoidberg," Yes, fellow patriots, I ate your flag. And I did it with pride. For to express oneself with doing a thing is the very essence of Freedom Day! Bless this planet and all its wonderful people!"
Fry, Hurry!
Fry, Oh. But what is it really?
Bender," Aw! Look at the cute, little— I was gonna go yachting in those feet!"
Zoidberg, Uh... Not bad. A hint of vitalis and—
Fry," Well, it took an hour to write. I thought it would take an hour to read."
Hermes, Not dangerous at all?
Hermes, Sweet bongo of the Congo!
Fry, I'm on it. And maybe I'll find those magic words while I'm at it.
Farnsworth," That's me at the very first symposium. I'm the Academy's oldest living member, you know. These youngsters all look up to me."
Amy," Oh, that's mine."
Bender, Did you just say--
Leela, No I don't. But I think we ought to meet with him and see if he'll help us rescue those animals.
Fry," It may have been a fake war, but my scuffed knee is all too real."
Fry," It's supposed to be a celebration, Leela. I mean, come on. Whimmy-wham-wham-whazle!"
Fry, I didn't order any--
Bender, I don't understand.
Leela, Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone.
Bender," Alright, fine, gather round."
Leela, She asked first.
Leela," You're absolutely right, Doctor. Can the collar come off now?"
Leela, It's that jerk from the truck stop! Let's cross the street and try to blend in with that crowd of pimps.
Hermes,   Argh! See you at the office!
Bender," Listen here, Malachi. Time for a religious donation. Hand over your wallet."
Leela," LaBarbara, Hermes, happy Kwanzaa. We brought a chocolate cake. But now I'm worried that might be offensive in some way."
Zoidberg," Uh-oh. Help! Help! Bender, you gotta spring me. I'll never survive in here; I'm too pretty!"
Fry," Sorry, ladies. Employees only."
Zoidberg," And the nominees for Best Actor are  Sir Lawrence-- ... in The Merchant of Venus, Hive Mind Gamma 7X in Bikini Party Summer, the Soda Machine Robot in Bikini Party Summer, Mark Jones in How Beige Was My Jacket and, instead of the fifth guy, Calculon, for his powerhouse performance in The Magnificent Three."
Leela," Hey, guys. You missed a great delivery to Space Earth. Where you been all afternoon?"
Hermes, This is mine. Right next to the center square.
Leela, It's only been 23 minutes.
Fry," Well, sure, but... You're always in it. Also, sometimes, terminators."
Zoidberg, I don't like the looks of this doctor. I bet I've lost more patients than he's even treated.
Bender, Anyone hear something?
Fry, I'd better go too. They don't know what I like.
Farnsworth," I call this the F-ray. It's like an X-ray only it allows you to see through anything, even metal. Now, the neutrino beam it emits is a tad dangerous, so you'll all need protective goggles. You may feel a slight stinging sensation -- all of you! Aha! There's the cause of your illness."
Fry," Well, could I at least get some encouragement? I could use a shot in the arm. I got shot in the leg!"
Leela," Well, if you don't like that, try some Archduke Chocula."
Leela, But eating an intelligent animal is different.
Leela, Ow! Ow!
Farnsworth, His power supply is shot! He is flatlining! Only one thing can keep him alive. Possibly this thing.
Leela," One side, boys. Let a lady take a gander."
Bender, Because the pain slowly fades but the love is forever.
Fry, No?
Bender," Hey, why don't you just sweat him out?"
Zoidberg," Get ready, Fry. I'm going to rip your swim bladder out and show it to you."
Farnsworth," Yes it's a tremendous responsibility, alright! What if a paper were to land in a puddle?"
Fry, It's not filth. It's a glorious monument to the achievements of the 20th century. Look! A real Beanie Baby. Oh! A Mr. Spock collector's plate! Some Bart Simpson dolls!
Fry, What up?
Bender," Come on, girl!"
Bender," Those could be anyone's thoughts, fat ass!"
Farnsworth," Oh, fuff. Enough of your superstitious nonsense. I'm sure that whatever is happening can be explained by science."
Fry," If that is Bender, I guess he's just happier in his new life."
Leela, Oh. Then get in the laundry room or I'll kick your butts!
Bender, A surprise funeral? For me?
Hermes, Ohh! ... Ug! ... Argh! ... Ahhhhhh. What are those?
Leela," We're playing poker. But I'm warning you, my friends are serious players."
Fry," Leela, I just want you to know that even though you're mean, you're the best captain ever."
Leela," Let Mom buy the company! We all wanna be filthy, stinking rich!"
Bender, Ow!
Bender, So now my character has a British accent?
Fry," Wait. Let me. Bender and I have our disagreements, but we're still friends and I'm gonna show him what that means. To the ship."
Fry," Would you cram a sock in it, Bender? Those aren't even medals, they're bottle-caps and pepperoni slices!"
Fry," Maybe we're all wearing magic rings but they're invisible rings so we don't even realise it. Also, you can't feel the rings."
Fry," That's a hell of a good parrot. Although, I could get 500 lizards for the same price. Girls like swarms of lizards, right?"
Bender, Oh.
Leela, Dark matter indicator?
Bender," No, a whole Bender-ful!"
Zoidberg, Never! Zoidberg doesn't abandon a friend apparently.
Fry, Wait. In a minute.
Zoidberg," Look who's here, everyone! It's Zoidberg, the lovable tramp!"
Bender," Oh, come on, you lazy jerks. If we all pitch in, we each only have to do one quintillionth of a thing."
Fry," Leela, let's turn back. There's absolutely no shame in wussing out."
Zoidberg, Someone used to care about me?! Hooray!
Fry, They'll save us. We're saved!
Zoidberg, Amy has a point.
Bender, There! Fixed forever.
Bender," Interracial,, Interplanetary,, even ghost and horse, but not robot and human."
Leela," The Professor said he was taking a brief nap, so we only have time for six movies."
Amy," If he catches you after dark, he'll chop off your head and stuff your neck full of toys from his sack of horrors."
Fry," But what if he wants to-- I mean, if he tries to ... uh ... Barry White?"
Bender, Boo?
Zoidberg, This isn't good for Zoidberg!
Fry, I can't believe it. She's risking her life for me after the way I treated her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.
Fry, Wait. This isn't a barrel. It's just a stinking cask! I want my money back! Ow! Ow!
Leela, Please! Just a few days.
Farnsworth," With that big new Romanticorp contract, I've been able to make those government-mandated upgrades you've all been suing me about."
Bender, What?
Amy, You poor man. What happened to you?
Fry," Wait, Bender. Bender?"
Bender, Wee!
Amy, Hooray!
Fry, Woah. That sounds like something Amy would say and eat.
Bender, Free-loading off you? I agree.
Fry, I like those odds. Rats. Just another tooth.
Leela, Your uncle was Harold Zoid?
Amy, This is all Obsessy Bessy's fault!
Zoidberg, Same place as your species  The beach.
Fry," Well, maybe you'll meet someone else someday."
Fry, Ooh! Yeah!
Leela, I'm trying!
Leela," It's no use. The tar is too thick. Plus, I think I flooded it."
Hermes, Leela.
Fry," Go, Hermes!"
Bender," This calls for a party, baby. I'm ordering a hundred kegs, a hundred hookers, and a hundred Elvis impersonators who aren't above a little hooking, should the occasion arise!"
Zoidberg, I live in a dumpster. All I have in the world is this coupon for one free session at the tanning salon.
Bender," Oh, I'm boned."
Hermes, Whatever.
Leela, There's the black box.
Leela," Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I guess I can't let you go alone."
Farnsworth, Twice as hard as your head! Which makes it still fairly soft!
Bender, Now we'll see who loves whom.
Bender," I'm Bender, baby! Please insert liquor!"
Amy, Never!
Fry, Me? Why?
Bender," Where are you hiding, you coward? Get out here and get murdered like a man!"
Leela, Hubba-hubba. Your pants go almost all the way to your ankles!
Leela, Stop the execution!
Amy, Huzzah!
Leela, Urgh!
Leela, What is all this? Am I a game to you? Or some kind of even more boring Truman Show? Do you believe I'm you Messiah? Your Mutant Dalai Lama? Stop me if I guess it!
Leela," Hey, you're enjoying this."
Fry," Aw, I know how you feel. My grandfather died recently."
Zoidberg, The king crab is to die for. Look! A tiny edible crown.
Leela, Where is the great fountain?
Amy, Lars is so flirting with you.
Zoidberg, They're hideous!
Fry," Look at it again. I know she thinks I'm immature, but someday I won't be. And deep down in my heart, I know we'll end up together. It's all there in the macaroni."
Leela," Well, if it's to save Earth, I-I guess I could take one for the team."
Fry, Leela! You shouldn't be listening. I don't want you to hear it till it's done.
Leela, I'll drop the anchor.
Bender, Hmmm. You ever made out with a tugboat?
Bender," Are you crazy? This place is great! Electroshock whenever you want it, two Lincolns for every Napoleon. Ah! Sweet light crude!"
Amy, Fore!
Fry, Hermes has all the fun. Wait a second! He's got a Brain Slug on his head!
Fry, Ooh! Uh-oh!
Bender," Oh, my God!"
Zoidberg," Ambassador Mervin, you and your staff are so kind. I'm truly humbled. What, no marshmallows?"
Bender," Hey! Keep it down, you kids! I'm trying to take a nap!"
Bender," Eh, the usual human stuff. He laughs, he learns, he loves."
Leela, A witch? That explains how these boots magically appeared on my feet.
Farnsworth," Ooh! Oh, you've killed me! You've killed me!"
Leela, Let's search the web. Over there.
Zoidberg," Sincerely, Harold Zoid. P.S. Cashier's check. Did you hear that? I'm going to Hollywood!"
Fry," He always wanted to drift forever, but through the American Southwest."
Fry, Yes!
Leela, What are you talking about?
Amy, He's walking on sunshine now.
Zoidberg, But comedy is in my valves. My Uncle Harold was a big Hollywood star back in the era of silent holograms.
Bender," You guys realise you live in a sewer, right?"
Bender," Oh, yeah, that's the good stuff. What am I doing? What have I become? Huh?"
Hermes," Alright, people. I will now outline today's 12-point agenda. We'll begin with point one, then race forward--"
Bender, That's even more awkward than Fry's two bimbos meeting each other. Count me in.
Fry," You wrote ""Commit the crime""!"
Hermes, He's the only man to ever win Olympic gold medals in both limbo and sex.
Leela," We'd better investigate. Looks like an Ion Storm, though. Everyone suit up!"
Bender, That's where he always goes.
Fry," Cool. Hey, what do you do if you want the trees up?"
Amy, Wow! That's actually a really good idea for a woman!
Farnsworth, You've got eight! But a more urgent concern is the microwave. Without a working one we have no hope of returning to the future.
Fry," You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours have been the happiest days of my life."
Leela, Right in front of you.
Bender," Gimmie you're biggest, strongest, cheapest drink."
Farnsworth," No, damn it! Just the alluring scent of Obsession for spaniels."
Zoidberg," Hey, what the--"
Amy, I made a blinding powder.
Bender, Quick.
Farnsworth, We'll have to bring her around again.
Amy," Oh, that's so sweet. But I sold my hair to a wigmaker so I could buy a set of combs for Hermes."
Leela," Doubledeal, this is disgraceful! You can't just rip off their real lives and put it on TV!"
Fry," There but for the flip of a coin go we. So, um, Leela? Seeing how the universe wasn't destroyed, you wanna catch an ape fight? You know, together?"
Fry, What if we hire a buttered geisha?
Bender, I'm okay then.
Farnsworth," Well, let's drag him to the kerb."
Hermes, I described it to them on the phone ... using a series of artful euphemisms.
Leela, Zookeeper! How did you know our real identities?
Leela," At first, I was consumed by a dark obsession to kill the whale. Then I was consumed by the whale."
Fry, We want Leela to be captain again.
Zoidberg, What? You mean I cut a big hole in him for nothing?
Bender, What?
Leela, Invaders! Possibly from space!
Fry," Bender, I'm only tellin' you this so you can avoid committing the crime."
Bender," Oh no, you didn't."
Fry," Hey, uh, Guenter? Why don't you get up on the chandelier with your parents and I'll take a picture?"
Fry," Lighten up, Leela. It's funny!"
Fry," Bender, it's us, your friends. You can drop the hillbilling moron act."
Bender, They are bronze.
Fry, I call your bluff.
Leela," But, Fry, what about us? What about your life on the surface? You don't belong down here."
Bender," Farewell, monobrains."
Hermes, Sweet manatee of Galilee! He's on the roof!
Amy," Fry, where's your Brain Slug?"
Bender, On the 4th day of Xmas I stole from that lady.
Hermes, Children of all ages.
Fry," Yeah, Leela."
Leela," OK, OK, I'll do the dishes. Hey, where'd they go?"
Fry," Wait, come back, uh, darling."
Fry," Unbelievable. It's an actual, factual Robot Hell."
Fry," Uh, yeah! That rings a bell."
Hermes, Scwatch its fwubby chin.
Zoidberg," It means it'll hatch into a tiny, little infant creature. Unless we cook it first. Hey, Leela! Hurry up with those scrambled infants!"
Bender, Beer! Ow!
Farnsworth," According to Bender's temperature gauge, which I suggest you use next time, Leela, he's running a fever of ... 900 degrees."
Bender, Ow!
Fry, Why aren't we moving?
Bender, Ooh! I'm gonna need to make some room.
Bender," Bender, your biggest fan."
Hermes, Repulsive?
Fry," No, it's an old Volkswagen van. Hey, Mister? Mind if I take this old van?"
Farnsworth, Da Vinci's lost workshop!
Farnsworth, Bender! Stop killing for a minute. The Fry you murdered was doomed anyway. See?
Leela, Yes! She is a rat!
Amy, I'll do it.
Fry," Well, he lost my vote."
Bender," Maybe if you clean up first. It looks like your neck stepped in something. Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body!"
Leela, Fry? What are you doing.
Fry, Meet me there in five minutes. It's important.
Farnsworth," Hmm. Let me see that vial, Bender. Good Lord! According to the spectrolizer, Spargle's magic ingredient was ... water. Ordinary water!"
Fry, Then it's time to make some more.
Fry," C'mon, Bender. If you're done scamming Beck, we're heading home."
Leela, What is it?
Zoidberg, I found the board!
Leela, I think we were saved by a mysterious orange blur.
Hermes, Fry! Don't be a hero! It's not covered by the health plan!
Fry, Hello 2000. I'm home.
Bender," Someone's ass. Oh, and guess what? I met all these really cool guys with treasure down in the limestone cavern, so I invited them to stick around instead of coming up when they were logically supposed to."
Farnsworth," My heavens! If only I'd heeded your warning, I'd have known it was impossible to cross the barrier!"
Farnsworth, You ... wha?
Bender, I try to get out but they keep pulling me back in.
Fry," Go, Professor!"
Leela, Too bad! 'Cause he's still alive!
Bender," Sure. No, wait. I was built in Tijuana. Maybe Inspector 5 still works there. He better do some splaining. Before I mash up some face guacamole."
Farnsworth, Very well. Let this abomination unto the Lord begin! Interesting. It seems Seymour died at the ripe old age of 15.
Bender, Yuck! That's the least appetising calzone I've ever seen!
Hermes," So what did you like better, my love? Bein' a man or a woman?"
Hermes," According to government records, the only names not yet trademarked are ""Popplers"" and ""Zittzers""."
Bender," Hold up! There's alcohol around here somewhere. My Tanqueray-dar is goin' crazy. Aha-ha! Thought you could get away from me, huh? You lose again, you stupid intoxicant!"
Bender, Yeah! All right! Yeah! He did it! And he's not even looking back at that cool explosion! He's a hero!
Zoidberg, Aw.
Leela, Hi-yah!
Leela," Mom, why have I never heard this?"
Amy," Oh, relax, Professor. ""Youthasizing"" is a trendy, new spa treatment. It's this season's shark-cartilage enema."
Leela, Stop it!
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone!"
Fry," You mean, the whole star is a single... Whoa! Sci-fi."
Fry, Yes!
Bender," Bender is great, oh, Bender is great. Bender, Bender, Bender!"
Zoidberg," Wrong, Mr. Genius."
Bender," Oh, man, there's always a catch!"
Bender," Up yours, bimbo!"
Fry, A shrimp? I find it a bit hard to believe that--
Fry, I can't believe we flew halfway across the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just to get lunch for that stupid animal!
Leela," Fry, can we talk about our relationship?"
Fry," I know I should but I just can't. Remember when I had those stomach worms that made me smart? I could play the holophonor and it made Leela like me. Hey, Bender, as long as you know, I have a holophonor recital Tuesday. I'd really like to have somebody there. Please?"
Zoidberg, What do you want me to say? 'E saved my life.
Fry," So, uh, how are you two snooky-poopums doing?"
Hermes," Hey, quit hogging the bottle-nose."
Zoidberg," I remember. I remember! This is what traumatised me. Such a meal to got to waste! And, with that... I have closure."
Fry," Then all hope is lost. Goodbye, Seymour."
Fry, Great! He's whacked out on electricity again.
Bender," Leela's right, fishing blows. Whattya say we make it interesting?"
Leela," If you don't mind, we're here to deliver the scissors for the ribbon-cutting."
Leela," Ndnd just wants what every she-beast wants, to feel like you're listening to her nagging. Is there anything she has been riding your ass about?"
Farnsworth, I remember it like it was interesting.
Amy," Really? Thanks, Dad."
Fry," Well, here goes nothing."
Hermes, It looks like toxic waste. And it smells like toxic waste.
Fry, I'm on your side.
Hermes, Goodnight.
Hermes, You rotten kids! Will you be hiring?
Fry," Come on, Leela! Step your big boot down on the gas pedal."
Fry, Well check it twice!
Fry, What the— No! Not the armpits! Winter's coming!
Fry," Whale, please."
Fry, I don't see you anywhere.
Leela, Aw. Come here. Let me give you a kiss. Hug. Handshake. I'll text ya.
Fry, I'm not talking to you!
Zoidberg, Three dollars at the drug store.
Farnsworth, No fair! You changed the outcome by measuring it.
Bender, What?
Hermes," Well, let's get on with it. Don't let my doomed body and my doomed marriage stand in the way of your happiness."
Fry, She's really strict.
Amy, Worms? Ew! Puke-a-tronic!
Fry," All this prolonged exposure to radiation is making me thirsty. Ah, if only there was some way of knowing which can had the winning bottle-cap inside."
Leela, So you let me dehydrate while you washed down the trail mix with imported mineral water?
Bender," Aw, quiet, you riot.  What's the worst that could happen?"
Bender,
Zoidberg, There but for the grace of God.
Bender, I don't know what to say.
Leela, Use boaty talk!
Fry, Over here!
Farnsworth," Well, I suppose the environment can take one more for the team."
Fry, What?
Hermes, Well I think Amy and Fry go together like a lime and coconut.
Bender, No?
Bender," What am I gonna do? I got an emperor all patsied up to switch bodies, but only with another robot!"
Leela, You guys could learn a lesson from those two.
Farnsworth," Ah, let's just keep watching."
Amy," So you called my thesis a fat sack of barf, and then you stole it?"
Hermes, Why won't anybody listen to me?!?
Fry, It's all stuff from that forbidden show.
Hermes," Bender, no! Suicide isn't necessarily the answer!"
Bender," Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!"
Bender, What?
Fry," So here shklee is shklerself, Yivo!"
Bender, No! No! Fancy men are defenseless against cone of coldness. I'm freezing... what? Ah!
Fry," Full price for gum? That dog won't hunt, monsignor."
Fry," He wouldn't do this in our sleep. He would not, could not to a sheep."
Bender," I found some rocks. You guys eat rocks, right?"
Bender," Ah, those stupid mutants can't do anything. You seem to be forgetting one simple fact. Namely, I'm up here and they are safely down--"
Zoidberg, Drop the Robut. I thought I told you. I do the cutting around here.
Leela, But it'll be destroyed when Leo Wong blows up the violet dwarf. So why are you helping him?
Leela," Gunnery Chief Bender, blast us out of quarantine."
Fry, You don't have a heart; you're a robot.
Leela, I don't know if they were mighty alien overlords or simply underpaid alien janitors who fought crime on the side--
Fry," Leela, I think you're missing the big picture. When you were a kid, what was your biggest fantasy?"
Bender," Yep, you wanna go grab a booze?"
Fry, Damn right!
Fry," Hey! Leggo my egg-o, crab-o!"
Farnsworth," Oh, I think we should just stay friends."
Fry," Well, you guys might both be losers but I just made out with that radiator woman from the radiator planet."
Bender, Who ... is ... it? Ow!
Fry, Yeah. Remember who your real friends are.
Bender," OK, they've got everything you need here  Booze, a couple of peanuts, they got a crapper in the back. That's one of the things you kids do, right?"
Fry, Yeah!
Farnsworth, Why you!
Farnsworth," Well now that death has been staved off momentarily, let me be the first to say congratulations Leela and Lars."
Fry, Leela! Shhh! I'm tryin' to listen to a physics lecture!
Bender, Next year in Jerusalem!
Fry," No! In fact, it looks so nice I think I might get one too."
Bender," What are you, senile? I'm not jumping in there."
Farnsworth, It wasn't by themselves! I put them there. I'm a genius. Get over it!
Fry, Ow! No! Quit it! Stop!
Bender, Hey! Those jerklings ate my couch.
Zoidberg, I choose my own claws! I want the tactile pleasure of chopping him right here in the gonads!
Fry, My God! Robot Saint James is a zombie.
Leela, You actually thought they'd let you walk away without an engine oil sex check?
Zoidberg, Blood ... thicker ... water.
Fry, Where are we ever going to find a lawyer to take his case?
Farnsworth," Correct. 6,000 hulls."
Hermes, Then prepare to see a bureaucrat's brain in action.
Leela," Yeah, he said something about running away. Then he ran away."
Leela, What?
Fry, Hmm. We lost Bender.
Fry," Banana, banana, banana!"
Leela, I'm too short to reach the handbrake!
Fry," Ooh, burn!"
Hermes, Yep!
Amy, It's coming up!
Fry," That's awful, Professor. Especially the making-out part."
