Bender," Say your prayers, Fry."
Bender, Time heals all wounds.
Zoidberg," Now it's time for my song! When I was two, there was a tidal wave in--"
Zoidberg, Stop yelling at me!
Farnsworth, Nice meeting you.
Fry," You weren't sleepwalking, you were sleep-bending!"
Hermes," Oh, the Colonial Desktop(?).  Well, there's nuthin' we Brits enjoy more dan a good document'ry. Turn on the televiser, Dr. Zoidsmythe."
Fry," Oh, hooray. It's handsome Lars and his fabulous jars."
Fry, It's that obnoxious monkey. He kept me up all night with his constant thinking. Just thinking and thinking. He's trying to make me look like an idiot.
Bender," (VO) ... and as soon as I was out of the scammers' control, I pulled the old switcheroo."
Farnsworth," Indeed. You see, that fossil was made of dolomite; The tough black mineral that won't cop out when there's heat all about. By contrast, observe the lava's affect on this ice swan. Of course, that would have melted even at room temperature. I just wanted to get rid of it. But had it been made of that righteous mineral dolomite, there's a slim chance it might have survived."
Bender," Goodnight, Calculon."
Leela," In fact, I shouldn't even be wearing this around here. It was brisk, I dressed in layers."
Amy, I do! Kif's given me dozens. Is it true what the ad says? That you kiss them together out of blanket cloth and magic buttons?
Fry," Well, you were gonna live in the closet anyway. Won't you be just as happy back in your old place?"
Fry," Please, can you take a message to Leela?"
Amy," Yes, you did, you dumb calamari!"
Leela, What about the sentries?
Zoidberg, Someone do something.
Bender," Not so neutral now, are you Sweden?"
Amy, What caused all that damage?
Fry," Well, this is the end. There was so many things I wanted to say to you."
Farnsworth," No, no. This won't do. A three-month calendar? What is this, Mercury?"
Leela, I don't believe it! It's dark matter.
Fry, Huh?
Amy, No kidding. These gifts have been coming non-stop! I think Calculon's falling for you.
Leela," Bender, thank God you're here. Talk some sense into the other machines."
Bender, Any jerk can tell her! Bender has a little more up his sleeve.
Fry," Good news, everyone!"
Fry, Bender's gonna be killed!
Leela," Oh, no! There's no global positioning signal! Navigation is failing."
Fry, Tell me what?
Leela, I don't know. But I'm not helping.
Fry, No wonder traditional media is dead!  Check out this webisode of Hypnotoad.
Bender," Tomorrow, at the family castle. Followed by the reading of his will. Well, I'm rich. Goodbye, losers, whom I've always hated! C'mon, it'll be fun!"
Bender, Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?
Hermes," A true inspiration for the children. Um, a little help please? Nooo!"
Bender," Oh, yeah, come on, baby."
Amy," I underestimated you, medical crab. But will the Aliens understand?!"
Fry," Sorry, everyone, but need I remind you? Blood is thicker than water."
Fry," Aw, man!"
Leela," Fortunately, I still have our old career chips."
Bender," Oh, yes, Elzar."
Bender, Huh? I choose to not understand these signs.
Fry, You little runts froze me! You took away my life!
Fry," You're mean, Rutherford B. Hayes!"
Fry," Not yet, commander. Yancy's just trying to steal my stuff as usual."
Fry, So what's the deal? You guys don't believe in Robot Jesus?
Zoidberg, Aha! Once again the conservative sangwich-heavy portfolio pays off for the hungry investor! Oh! I'm ruined. Why? Why?
Leela, What? You can give me new ears? Wait. What seemingly reasonable thing do you want in return?
Bender, Going through the 'bot wash!
Amy," Hey! You're the unfrozen guy! From the 20th century, right?"
Fry," Hey, I'm begining to think you guys don't think I'm very smart."
Bender, I'm just here for what's mine. Don't make me kick your neck.
Leela," Does anyone else think it's odd that a shiftless 25-year-old delivery boy could drop out of the sky, kill the emperor and be rewarded instead of punished?"
Zoidberg, Hooray!
Hermes," Your body may be as perfectly-sculpted as it was 20 years ago when you whupped my fat ass every time we met. But today, I feel lucky."
Leela," Wait, this could be a good thing. That weaponized virus made the sickly little tree grow big and strong."
Farnsworth, Don't worry. They'll be fine once the tranquiliser wears off.
Leela, So what did you get me?
Fry, The spoon's in the foot powder.
Bender, Who threw that?
Zoidberg," It's funny. You live in the universe, but you never do these things till someone comes to visit."
Fry, I get it!
Fry," No, I'm not! Oh, wait, I am. But my point remains valid!"
Farnsworth," Yes, she's a wonderful ship, all right. As beautiful now as the day I got botched laser eye surgery. Now, that's odd. What's the fuel gauge doing on the fl... Great Godzilla's gonads! Who wasted precious fuel? Answer now or be punished."
Farnsworth," In your time yes, but nowadays, shut up! Besides, these are adult stem cells harvested from perfectly healthy adults, whom I killed for their stem cells."
Bender," God, yes, Elzar."
Hermes, Santa!
Bender," Yeah. Maybe it just learned to talk as a parlour trick, like Fry."
Leela," Hey, watch it! You'll put somebody's eye out!"
Leela," Yeah, you almost ate me once. I was in your mouth for five minutes."
Farnsworth," Leela, evolution has programmed our fabulous male brains to take anything anybody else thinks is important and make it bigger. Have you seen my new 301-inch TV?"
Fry," Oh, yeah? Could a dream take you dancing in a Venusian garden?"
Bender," Give me the keys, Magoo."
Bender, Look at these swanky tombs! These people really know how to die.
Fry, Firing torpedo number three!
Fry, Zero. One. One. One. Zero. Zero. One. One!
Zoidberg," Not too bad. Last year, I took a bus trip to the Grand Canyon. Later, I'll show you the pictures."
Fry," Amy, tend to the widow Pac-Man."
Leela, Since when are you performing at children's parties?
Leela," Oh, Lord."
Farnsworth," Come on, Zoidberg, I passed it right to you."
Bender," Ah, quit your bellyaching and take it like a robot."
Farnsworth," Don't be jealous. Without his special hat, Guenter might be no more intelligent than you."
Leela," How can you call the Native Martians ""stupid""?"
Leela, Then you'll be fired--
Hermes, I can't compete with that.
Fry, OK.
Fry," Alright, let's get to work."
Fry," Hey, cool! Dark side of the moon!"
Bender, A little? You're screwier than my Aunt Rita. And she's a screw!
Fry, Wow! You're some guy who eats at Fishy Joe's?
Amy," Aw, pooh! We're even younger!"
Leela, So he just ran away in the middle of the exam?
Leela, No.
Amy, Yeah!
Zoidberg, Hmm. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. Guess again.
Fry, Now do you believe me?!
Bender," You did it, Fry!"
Bender," So lonely. Poor, sad Bender."
Fry, Leela? What are you guys doing here in the year 4000?
Bender," True, but at least I don't have the hiccups anymore. What up?"
Hermes," You been hittin' the Red Stripe, woman!"
Bender, Wait. I don't even have DNA. Why am I screaming?
Bender, I just wanted to be part of the moment.
Farnsworth," Oh, uh, what? I'm awake, I'm awake!"
Fry," What, Bender? Is something wrong?"
Bender, Memory?
Bender, Bingo!
Bender," Ah, let me bus that for you, gentlemen. No, what I meant to do was--"
Fry, The year 4000 is severely disappointing. I miss the year 3000 when life was simple and brains flew through space and everyone ate lasers.
Amy," You miss him, too?"
Farnsworth," That makes the most sense of all. Look at the planets it's destroyed so far.  First came XXX, the nude beach planet.  Then Poopiter. €$!#%&"" comes on screen.] And finally that world that can't be mentioned in polite company."
Leela," Zoidberg, I'm gonna put my boot so far up your cloaca, you'll be... Ow!"
Farnsworth," We're almost there. The crystals are beginning to engorge. I can't quite reach. Fry, grab onto my easy-fit waistband. Just a few more inches. Come on, really wedgie it on in there. So, that's why they call me the Catman."
Leela," Oh, crud. I knew there was something I meant to do today."
Fry," I'm sorry, Leela, I can't go on any further. Just leave me to die in that barn over there."
Fry, Yee-haw!
Bender, You... You're leaving? But why can't Yivo just move in with us? We'll put a cot in Europe.
Leela, A puppy? Nibbler loved to eat puppies.
Amy," Sorry. I thought I saw a tentacle, but it was just a harmless land squid. I better have some cocoffee."
Bender, That's puffin talk. Now follow me!
Bender," Aw, jeez with this, hey?(?)"
Zoidberg," Uh, OK. How much do I have to invest?"
Farnsworth, Phew!
Fry," Lucy Liubot, if I don't survive the corn, I want you to know that I love you as much as a man can love a computerised image of gorgeous celebrity. Which it turns out is a lot."
Bender," Sorry, it's not quite finished."
Bender, Saved you.
Farnsworth," Scruffy, what is that tiny Bender doing in my soup?!"
Amy," Ew, that is so gross!"
Fry, I've had better.
Bender," and  ...doorstop,"
Hermes," Scram, you lousy green snakes! Here, Leela. Take this and use it to shoot those guys."
Bender, I can fetch.
Bender, The costume contest! The costume contest!
Amy, Einstein was right.
Leela, This sort of thing always happens with office romances.
Fry, But you just said--
Farnsworth," The snail itself is composed of cells, molecules, atoms..."
Fry, What? Who possibly think you're stupid?
Farnsworth," But you could get a new body! You could have a rich, full life!"
Leela," Professor, we've talked it over and everybody thinks you're too old."
Fry," So, uh, Flexo. Sorry about crushing your body like that. You OK now?"
Farnsworth, What?
Fry," Oh, my God!"
Bender, Who did?
Leela," Fry, I know those cookies are fresh-a-licious but they produce an awful lot of trash."
Bender, Frying pans! Cast-iron frying pans!
Amy, Way to go.
Bender," Hmm. Those peewees think I'm God, huh? Hard to blame 'em! I am the Metal Lord. Who are you?"
Bender, You're lookin' good to Flexo tonight.
Hermes," You're a crazy, penniless, lobster doctor. No combination of you should be a comedian."
Bender," Calm down, Leela. You can vent tonight on your blog."
Fry, I'm sorry.
Leela, But he's just a tool to make your life easier. Like a socket wrench or a burglar's kit.
Zoidberg," Only $14.99 for a two-record set. Two records! Oh, Zoidberg, at last you're becoming a crafty consumer!"
Leela," Your Honour, I move for a mistrial, on the grounds that I'm also having a hot, naked affair with the foreman of this jury."
Fry, But— Bender?! What happened to you?
Amy, You again? Get away you mangy ball of Histamines.
Bender, Slide me those chicken wings. So what part of Podunk you rubes from?
Farnsworth, My name's Hubert.
Bender, I never said I wasn't a drama queen.
Amy, Look! Spirit!
Farnsworth," That's from Xmas and Robanakuh, you plagiarizing lout!"
Fry, Hm. A giant brain is basically a giant nerd. And where would a giant nerd be? The libary!
Leela," Come on, Adlai. She could really use a mom and dad."
Farnsworth, Whoa! Whoa! Woo!
Leela, Then what am I s'posed to do?
Leela," I don't have words to say how wonderful you are, Fry. I haven't felt this happy since double-soup Tuesday at the orphanarium."
Farnsworth," Oh, very well."
Fry," Well, I'm moving out!"
Bender, Hey! Don't make me go upside your head!
Bender," Yes Miss Leela, tote that space barge, lift that space bale."
Bender, But they could be meetin' anywhere!  What are we gonna do? Search building to building?
Bender," Elzar, you're my God. Please sign this sketch I drew of you. Oh, Elzar! Bless you!"
Fry," Pft, that's not scary!"
Bender, No. No! Can I have another fifty dollars?
Bender," And then the Donbot said, ""Sorry, Calculon."""
Leela," My God, we're out of that weird, crazy world and back in our regular crazy world."
Fry, How 'bout Löbrau? It has dots on it.
Hermes, I can see sideways in time.
Bender, That is 'ow you communicate!
Farnsworth," And though the world is now spinning in the wrong direction, it's good enough. Well done, Amy."
Farnsworth," Of course, that was the Panama Wormhole, Earth's central channel for shipping!"
Leela, Now he's flushed himself down the toilet? Who's he gonna flush next?
Farnsworth, Wait! What's that glistening in the chamber pot?
Leela, Fry's right. It's time to sit on Santa's lap -- and hard!
Leela," Come on, Fry. Let's go home an'—"
Fry, Stop rubbing it in!
Fry, No!
Bender," Well, OK. But I don't want people thinking we're robo-sexuals. So, if anyone asks, you're my debugger."
Leela," Detonation in three, two, one."
Leela, You have a night job?
Leela, What?
Hermes," Spacewalk, people! Spacewalk for your lives!"
Leela," You keep saying that, but you have to give me something to go on or I..."
Hermes," Yes, but not the original. Bender went back in time and picked up a copy."
Fry, What? I haven't changed. Suz? Have I changed?
Zoidberg, Did someone say something about a free hot meal?
Fry," To the left! No, to the up! U-turn! U-turn!"
Hermes," There's always next year, Professor. There's always next year."
Farnsworth, Consider the philosophical and metaphysical ramifications of the--
Leela," Look, I know it's not much consolation but I understand how you feel."
Bender, No! My cheating unit malfunctioned! You gotta give me a do-over!
Bender," Well, I'm off."
Bender, Happy!
Leela, You lousy...
Fry," Previously, on Futurama."
Fry, But it's a useless antenna. It's not like he's a ham radio or something.
Leela, Now it needs to boil for a couple hours.
Farnsworth," I refuse to believe anyone is happy! Mr. West, would you mind if I examined your brain?"
Zoidberg," But if Leela should find out, her dignity sac will rupture."
Bender," Well, let's get looting!"
Bender, Here we are. Your new home.
Fry, Exactly.
Bender, Cornwood!
Bender," I'm working on my song. Hand me the Becktionary. No, no, the rhyming Becktionary."
Fry, Looks like eating rocks wasn't as dumb as you said.
Amy, Clool!
Bender, Wow! Heavy-drinking crowd! I'd better go out for more beer.
Bender," Hello, boys! Your eyes say no, but your machine gun fire says-"
Leela, Or die trying.
Leela, Halt! What are you doing in this parallelogram of space?
Fry, You mean you have to choose between a life without sex and a gruesome death?
Leela," Bender, this is stupid. Why would anyone come to you for romantic help?"
Leela, I'm willing to take that risk.
Bender," Hambone! Hambone! Hambone. Okay, hambone break's over. Back to the bedroom."
Bender," I'm back! Everyone at Kinko's was an idiot, so I just brought the original."
Fry, Yeah! Let's do those Leela things.
Fry, My God. What if the secret ingredient ... is people?
Fry, My roommate's a monkey?
Bender," No, we're fine."
Bender, Just like titanium!
Amy, Lean back more!
Fry, I think you mean hit me.
Bender," Yeah! It's gonna be fun on the bun! Y'know, Fry, of all the friends I've had, you're the first."
Zoidberg," Hello, I remembered you like superheroes so I painted you a mural on your wall. This is Father-Man. He fights crime to earn Son-Boy's respect. Is it working?"
Amy, Right on.
Bender, In that case - let the dancing begin! Hey you guys are good. How the hell do you do that??
Farnsworth, Hold out your hands and I'll remove your career chips.
Leela," Oh, sorry. Nibbler!"
Bender, Stupid rocks! Think they're so great!
Leela," Uh, ever been to Peru?"
Leela, Check!
Bender," Oh. Well, I'm just saying I'd like you to show an interest in my life, too."
Leela, Mmm! So fresh an' musty!
Farnsworth, That's because the doomsday device I shoved all up in you puts out 50 gigawatts. That's ten times your recommended--
Leela, But I saw Earth explode!
Fry," I'm sorry. Hug me, Liubot."
Farnsworth," Hmm, you!"
Fry," Well, uh, I've got 33 minutes."
Bender, Hello? Is anyone still alive? How about in the porno theatre? Don't be embarrassed. They're dead. All dead. Who would have known playing God could have such terrible consequences?
Fry," Look  I know 'e's ugly and kinda corrosive, but we can't murder someone just 'cause he's hideous an' annoying."
Bender, Now to figure out how much money I'm raking in off those twerps! Oh! I need a calculator.
Farnsworth, So you opened the record vault and the clover was gone?
Hermes," Joyous Kwanzaa, everybody."
Fry, Welshie?
Farnsworth," Come on, everyone. Perhaps some skiing will help us forget the mouldy old antics of Conan O'Brien."
Bender, Oh!
Fry," Oh, boy! It's Santa!"
Fry, SunnyD commercial.
Amy, I forgot to give you something before you left.
Bender, That's a good one.
Fry," I have no opinion. Well, good night."
Leela, It's explosive! Maybe we could escape by setting fire to the distillery and blowing this whole place to rubble! Let's get a little kindling going!
Fry, My lucky shoe!
Bender," Oh, but you can. Though you may have to metaphorically make a ""deal with the devil"". And by ""devil"" I mean ""Robot Devil"". And by ""metaphorically"" I mean ""get your coat""."
Bender, This is a story about all my friends!
Leela," Bender, this is Fry's decision ... and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life."
Zoidberg," Hiya! Hiya! Hiya! So what's the deal with airline food, hmm? They offer you two choices, but they're always outta one. Uh, by the way, we're outta both choices."
Bender," You're going down, my friend! Down Under!"
Fry," Bender, if you say the A-word, you'll blow this planet straight to the H-word!"
Farnsworth, What's going on in here? Oh. Now I'm really outraged.
Hermes," Off on your first delivery, eh? You be careful, my little tinkler. Remember we used to call you that, huh? Tinkler?"
Bender, Six-to-three? I beat the spread!
Bender," Guys, you'll never believe what happened. First I was God, then I met God!"
Leela, Listen. Just go behind those garbage cans. I'll stand guard.
Bender," Y'know, I don't recall having done anything for a while. But I still feel like I deserve a smoke. Hey, cool, the air's on fire."
Leela, Maybe we ought to do something nice for him.
Bender, Just hang on! I'll take care of that fire!
Bender, Yup.
Leela," Actually, I guess I'm starting to associate it with the pleasure of beating people up."
Hermes, Mm.
Amy," I can't figure why she's so nice to you, Fry."
Fry," Keep going, we're right behind you."
Amy, Sploops!
Hermes," Uh, he's my pencil sharpener."
Leela, What the hell happened?
Leela," Right, right. You have to stop this madness."
Hermes," Good Lord, man! What kind of temporary woman are you?"
Farnsworth," That question is less stupid, though you asked it in a profoundly stupid way. What would happen if Fry never came to the future?"
Hermes," Don't worry now, Amy!"
Leela," Moose, Mandy; this is my friend Fry, from the surface."
Farnsworth, And the good news keeps on coming. Behold my latest invention.
Leela," Oh, Fry! You must be alive; I've never been treated so romantically by my own imagination before."
Leela, Get out of my office!
Fry, I'd prefer someone from the era of shaved underarms. Do you have anything with more of a Lucy-Liu-feel to it?
Leela," Listen. We actually came down here to find our pet, Nibbler. He got flushed down the toilet."
Zoidberg, You stay out of my dumpster!
Bender," Rest in hell, Crapville!"
Farnsworth," I really shouldn't agree to things I don't understand, but I'm slightly thirsty."
Leela," Fry, are you alright? What happened?"
Bender," Perfect. Viewers of the world, do smoking and drinking on TV really make me cool? Of course they do. How 'bout committing crimes and violence? Again, the answer is ""yes"". But do we really want our kids exposed to that kind of trash on TV? I say absolutely not! Uh ... on the other hand, most, perhaps all the blame, rests with the parents. That's right, you! And so I ask you this one question  Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?"
Fry, Just leave me alone.
Bender, Hey hold on a second I forgot to deliver the package.
Farnsworth," In each gastro-survival kit, you'll find a rain slicker, a disposable fun camera, and something to protect you against bacteria -- a harpoon!"
Hermes, Oh!
Leela," I hate to pop your blimp-like ego, but you're not perfect."
Bender, Hit the deck!
Zoidberg, What category are they on?
Leela," Fry, you can't bid against Mom; she's the richest, most powerful person in the world. And she's so adorable."
Hermes, These are mighty tasty!
Farnsworth," My God, this is an outrage! I was going to eat that mummy! Fry has got to go!"
Farnsworth," This is uncomfortable and humiliating. Now, if they could put it in the form of a suppository."
Leela," I vote my 10,000 shares for the Professor."
Bender, Too exact if you ask me. Tear it down and try again. But this time don't embarrass yourselves.
Farnsworth," I just need to reduce it down into this pickle jar, toss in a bay leaf to impress those stupid judges."
Fry, We've decided to work together.
Farnsworth," Happy birthday, young Nibbler."
Fry," Morgan, come back! He's stuck in a loop."
Fry, Bender! Are the steam cells working?
Farnsworth," Forget it, you pixilated pirates. We need those quarters to do our laundry."
Bender," Well, it was worth a shot."
Bender, Guys! Guys! Guess who just got commissioned as a tugboat!
Amy, Leela!
Fry, Why don't you just remove my tattoo?
Zoidberg," Yeah, come down off your round, white pulpit! You're just gonna eat that thing, anyway!"
Leela," Really? What type is she? You know, blonde, or Chinese, or Cyclops?"
Fry, Just stwoke its fwffy fur.
Zoidberg, I'm not the Tunneling Horror.
Farnsworth," Yes, I see. Something involving that many big words could easily destabilise time itself."
Leela, Professor! Can't you examine my brain without removing it?
Zoidberg, Or maybe a doctor?
Fry," That's it! You can only take my money for so long before you take it all, and I say enough. I've got one dollar left, and this one I'm holding on to! Oh, no you don't! I may not know much about horses but I know a lot about doing anything for one dollar! If you think bad luck can defeat me then you don't know my name is Philip J.--"
Fry," Alright, alright. If it'll make you happy, I'll overthrow society."
Amy," Look, everyone wants to be like Germany but do we really have the pure strength of will?"
Zoidberg," They come to feast after the frenzy. Once my species passes on its genes, it dies."
Fry, See you guys Monday!
Hermes," There, there, mon. It's gonna be okay. You are Bender, which is something Inspector 5 will never be."
Bender," Shinier than yours, meatbag!"
Bender, I may have a burgling familiarity with it.
Fry, Mightiness? Are you off your nut? I just got kidnapped by a bunch of guinea pigs.
Hermes," Perhaps the Professor's files can clear things up. ""Citation for public nudity"", ""Conspiracy to commit public nudity"". Aha! A new will! Naming ... ... you as his sole heir."
Leela," Well, you can't expect me to write it here, with everyone talking so loudly about how great I am."
Farnsworth, That's not good enough.
Fry, We just 'ave to find the Nerd Search '88 satellite!
Bender," Ah, it's nothing a lawsuit won't cure."
Bender, So what's your problem?
Leela, It's not a big deal.
Bender, Oh! No!
Bender, So we can leave early?
Fry," That's not an astronaut, it's a TV comedian. And he was just using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife."
Fry, Almost there. Just two more bottles.
Bender, He's pending for a bending.
Hermes," Wait a second, I'm not big-boned, I'm just fat."
Hermes, This is torture. The fever. The chills. And the sweating! Amy's horrible sweating!
Leela, No!
Leela," If this is anything like killing that pigeon on my balcony, we've got our work cut out for us."
Fry, I hid it in a secret hiding place whose location I never told anyone. Not even Scruffy.
Zoidberg, Scalpel. Blood bucket. Priest. Next patient.
Amy, Let's all take her out tonight. There's lots of great places to meet people.
Zoidberg, And I'm his friend Jesus!
Zoidberg, He's good.
Farnsworth," Oh, I've been there. Lots of times!"
Bender, But--
Bender, All that and a small wiener? This guy's got it goin' on.
Leela," Fry, you idiot. Ever since I was abandoned on Earth I've been searching for who my people are and where they come from. Then I finally meet another Cyclops and you blast him. You wrecked my one chance to learn who I am!"
Fry, And here I am.
Amy, Invented what?
Bender, Yeah?
Fry," Uh, jeez, don't get upset. I mean, OK, I outwitted you, but--"
Fry, Oh my God! We have to go down and rescue him.
Farnsworth," Yes, well, these things happen. Fortunately the sphereoboom is still safe."
Farnsworth, So stay with me until the symptoms start. Then... Put me out of my misery. You must swear!
Fry, You're gonna be the ships cook?
Farnsworth," So? Lots of important inventions are made from toilet paper tubes. Microscopes, the internet, tentacle polish..."
Fry, I'm as worthless as this trash can.
Fry, There's our man!
Fry," Uh, this is a bit awkward.  Or is it?"
Leela, Not another dream! Fry's jacket! The one he was buried in! My dream was real! He's alive!
Zoidberg," Yo, yo, yo! Whassup, whassup! Give up the rock!"
Bender," You idiot, I'm not a cannon!"
Leela, But this electricity abuse crossed the line. You almost killed us.
Zoidberg, Hooray! People are paying attention to me!
Zoidberg, Aha!
Bender," And from now on, you're all named Bender Jr.! Lookie here! My first government stipend cheque! 12 baby humans, 1200 wing-wangs!"
Fry, Yay!
Leela, But that's the best shot of the day!
Fry," You know what I like best about you, Umbriel? You find me fascinating even when I'm not claiming to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer."
Farnsworth," Thanks. Say, where did you get that lantern?"
Bender, Hey! That galaxy's signalling in binary. I gotta signal back. But I only know enough binary to ask where the bathroom is. You speak English?
Farnsworth," Oh, fuff."
Farnsworth," da Vinci was history's greatest artist and inventor. Voilà! He invented flying machines, war engines, submarines."
Hermes, Bender saved.
Hermes, My Manwich!
Leela, We don't have to stand here and take abuse from a gross nerd.
Amy," Well, there goes the neighbourhood. There goes another neighbourhood."
Fry, It's good to be home.
Hermes, Very well.
Amy, Kappa Kappa Wong.
Fry," Excuse me, have you seen a giant brain?"
Fry," Wow, a whole planet of old people. Where is it?"
Farnsworth, Deciphering that ID code is critical.  I'll be in the Chamber of Understanding.
Bender, You're right. I'm a lost cause.
Zoidberg, He was the only one of you who never struck me.
Farnsworth, Wonderful.
Amy, The city council renamed it in 1975. Ooh! Those are great shoes!
Zoidberg, Host-man! Host-woman! I'm having a wonderful time!
Bender, More like three lockers and a sink!
Bender," Oh, and while you're there, pick me up a few credit card numbers."
Bender," My roommate's gone. And all he left behind was an eyelash and three skin flakes. Oh, what's the point?"
Fry," Mr. Nimoy, I came as soon as I heard what happened centuries ago. I can't believe your show was banned."
Leela, This is all a big load. I was the one trying to save the Popplers. You were sucking them down like the fat hog you are and you were stepping on them for fun. You both should be in here instead of me.
Bender, ...Can do 'most anything!
Fry," Leela's not a killer, and she's not some chick. She's the chick I love. And don't tell her I called her a chick, or she'll kill me."
Fry, I can't swallow that.
Leela, No problem. The ship's fixed except for the cup holder and I should have that operational within 10 hours.
Farnsworth," Yes, that sequence of words I said made perfect sense. We really should tell Bender there's nothing to be afraid of."
Amy," Well, I guess we failed. But what matters is, we tried our best and we looked good doing it."
Leela, I said pet him.
Fry, What?
Fry, That's not how it happened.
Fry," Oh, so it's a little safer than skateboarding."
Fry, That's ridiculous. Mr. Peppy doesn't eat bones. I raised 'im on a simple diet o' Brussels sprouts an' mixed soda.
Bender," Hmm, sewers. Thinking, thinking, thinking."
Leela, No!
Farnsworth," Oh, my! There's a frog on a bump on this log that I found in a hole in the bottom of the sea!"
Leela," Well I, uh, I thought I might like him on a full stomach."
Fry, I can't believe it! How'd you all end up here?
Leela, Keep cool. She's just like any other player. She puts on her sports bra one arm at a time.
Fry," Thanks, eagle eye."
Bender, But why?
Leela, This planet is the real Rumbledy-Hump. And these creatures are the real Humplings. All I did was write down their adorably repetitious hijinks.
Amy, Not where it counts.
Fry," Why couldn't she be the other type of mermaid, with the fish part on top and the lady part on the bottom?"
Bender," Shut up, square! I'll just be a minute!"
Farnsworth, No. It must have something to do with those time particles I used to grow the Supermen. Time and space are ripping apart at the seams.
Leela," Thank you, Professor. I'm happy that Bender can finally feel my pain."
Bender, Eh.
Amy, They're doing something downstairs. We've got to find out what.
Amy, Yes.
Fry, No! It wasn't me!
Zoidberg, That pig over there is wearing the same sandals as me.
Farnsworth, Ouch! That's going to bleed when my heart beats.
Bender," I prefer the term ""love machine""."
Farnsworth, Isn't it obvious? You are!
Bender," Coming through, watch your heads!"
Fry, She sure does.
Bender, Whoa!
Leela, Does it really work?
Farnsworth, Whatever.
Fry," I'm so sorry I ratted you out, but, you know, after two weeks down here, I'll truly understand the plight of the mutant people."
Fry," Well, you're cuter that way."
Bender, This mob's with me.
Bender," Those marvellous scammers sure scammed us, huh?"
Hermes," There, there, wife. Everything will be all--"
Fry, He still sounds sorta old. Sorta real old.
Bender," I'm a-comin' Ow! Lousy primitive body! Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade? I'm an outdated piece of junk!"
Fry, That was the old Fry. He's dead now.
Bender, Hide me!
Farnsworth," Duh, I know! Let's play the lottery!"
Bender," Then good day, madam! We hope to see you soon for tea."
Fry, He's right! I've gotta start investing wisely.
Leela, It's a great mammal! See? It's got whiskers! And I saw it lactating earlier. Wait. Who said that?
Leela," I just don't get it. Who was this Ted Danson, and why would you pay $10,000 for his skeleton?"
Bender," Hey, I got a busted ass here, I don't see anyone kissing it."
Farnsworth, Nooo!
Fry, Wow! Nude hot-tubbing? That's all I need to hear about Freedom Day!
Leela, How does it work?
Bender," What do you say, folks? Hot or not?"
Fry," Um, let me think. Come and knock on our door, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh. Uh, Mr. Roper--"
Hermes, Now look at all the work I gotta do! Ow!
Hermes, Babylon's bells! I tallied almost 300 bananas on this entertainment product. Now you put 'em on and have fun.
Bender, Wow.
Fry, My nose is an aphrodisiac? I'm gonna drop a barf!
Leela," Oh, Lord, not Robanukah."
Bender," Ahh, yes, I'm here to repair my horse."
Fry," Leela, listen. You're the most beautiful woman I've ever known."
Amy," OK, it's your turn."
Bender, I'm a real toughie!
Fry," Alcohol fuels my power cells. And as a mighty robot, I-- Beep."
Fry, What? What are you talking about?
Fry, It's been two weeks. You wanna play tic-tac-toe again before we eat our shoes?
Amy, Snuh-uh! You're making us look like jerks in front of the other genders.
Zoidberg, Eh! It's all my favourite patients. And also Captain Tucker. Pow!
Leela," You're both alcoholic, whore-mongering, chain-smoking gamblers?"
Farnsworth, I'm OK then.
Fry, Wow! I never would have thought of that!
Amy, What about crying?
Leela," Hey, great idea!"
Fry," I'm walking on sunshine! Oh-oh-oh! I'm walking on sunshine! Oh-oh-oh! That a boy, Seymour! Right here waiting for me as always. Just like that huge mushroom in my shower."
Fry, Stop the cloning.
Leela, It's like I'm looking at an exact robot duplicate of myself.
Bender," Get it off! Get it off! Get it-- Uh-oh! How many roads must a man walk down, before you-- Keep those things off of me! Magnets screw up my inhibition unit!"
Amy," Leela, you're crushing me with your rock-hard butt."
Fry, Aw! Aren't you a fuzzy wittle guy?
Fry, I feel awful. But it was worth it to catch an' kill this baby fish.
Hermes, Impossible!
Fry, That's my clover! Yancy stole it!
Leela," Just ... my left hand? Um, uh--"
Leela, Admit it! You don't care about the inner me at all!
Hermes, No!
Hermes," Oh, heavens, no! We apologise, with nice, cheap words!"
Farnsworth," We'll form a search party. Now, we'll need oxygen."
Farnsworth," Now, it's not hard to spot a phoney Internet come-on. ""Get rich quick x7 q""? Phoney. ""Lose weight with space parasites""? Phoney. What's this? I've won the Spanish National Lottery?"
Bender, The last human ghost. But robot ghosts?
Farnsworth, Let's just say it'll put you young whippersnappers in your place!
Leela," Jumpin' Joe an' golly jeeper, I got one gigantic peeper. Sassafras an' banana oil, I'm a bee-youtiful purple-haired goyl."
Leela," This is unbelievable. I thought you were a furry little moron. But here you are flying an adorable spaceship. If only you could talk. Wait! I understood that! You say you're transmitting your thoughts directly to my brain. You say those awful flying brains are making everyone on Earth stupid? Oh, stupider. And you go on to say that we're headed for your home planet where your race has lived since the beginning of the universe? So, how did the universe begin? Then the meaning of existence-- So every religion is wrong!"
Leela," It figures. Who else but Zapp Brannigan would be judging the most chauvinistic, degrading, dehumanising--"
Bender," Ba-da-ba-da-ba-dip-That's all you get, jerks!"
Fry, Is any of that a problem?
Fry," But you are lazy, right?"
Fry, Wait. That's the bead you traded your land for?
Bender," Well then what do you think you should stop doing? Crawl, pigs!"
Fry," You doin' alright out there, buddy?"
Bender," Oh, God! Then it's worse than I think."
Bender," Well, he wasn't in the, uh, kitchen room."
Leela, We're just as good as any of those other crews you sent to their deaths. What's the mission?
Fry," Mrs. Astor, deep in the sewers, we discovered the wreck of the Land Titanic, on which your husband land-drowned. Inside was something that might interest you."
Fry," Phew! Uh, ladies first."
Leela," That's it, Fry. As your captain I order you back to the ship. You are in way over your head."
Farnsworth, You overclocked Bender?! What did I teach you about tinkering with machinery?
Fry," Hey, that's what I do."
Leela," Thanks, Adlai. I guess you never really outgrow being an eyeball-- Oddball!"
Bender, Are they the Robot Mafia?
Hermes, Oh! The ultimate penalty!
Fry," Right. I mean sure, she's a mutant, we've known that for years. But we kept it a secret because she's a fine, upstanding..."
Bender, And mean.
Farnsworth, Regular or conjugal?
Farnsworth, Monkeys aren't donkeys! Quit messing with my head!
Bender," But, then we wouldn't be roommates."
Zoidberg, I'm expressing my sorrow.
Farnsworth," Wait, I'm confused. Now tell me, Fry, which one of these ladies are you involved with?"
Fry, Except in Kansas.
Fry, What about what?
Leela, Have you seen today's news?
Farnsworth," Yes, we all miss our loved ones and gases. Come on, Fry."
Fry," Thanks, Professor!"
Fry, Same thing.
Farnsworth," Alright, but don't run with them."
Leela," Zapp?  Zapp, wake up!"
Fry, Now ask her how her day was.
Bender, Still ... can't ... reach!
Bender, Save my friends! And Zoidberg!
Farnsworth," Well, that's it. I'm afraid traditional medicine has failed."
Zoidberg, It's a movie.
Fry," So, uh, what do you feel like doing?"
Hermes," Sir, please, I must located the disk with my friend's brain on it."
Bender," You know it, pork pie! Except for one thing."
Farnsworth," Maybe something about ourselves, Leela. Wait! What's under that blanket? My God! da Vinci's Vitruvian Man!"
Zoidberg, Then it's settled. Hermes will relax and Zoidberg will eat. Hurrah!
Bender," So, you got six bucks left to retire on. I recommend Tender Vittles."
Farnsworth," Look, it started out as a calculated plot to rummage through your underwear. But once I got in there, I found more -- much more. And now I want to shout our love from the rooftops. Perhaps I'll breed some sort of albino shouting gorilla."
Bender, Thare she blows!
Bender, Woo!
Farnsworth, Baseball?? God forbid!
Fry, Um... Would it be possible to break off a piece an' put it in an engagement ring for reasons that are private?
Fry," Bye, Animatronio!"
Fry, Thank you.
Leela, Aw! Nibbler made a bobo for Mamma. I'll pick it up with my super-dupey poopy scoopy.
Bender," Fate is cruel and unyielding and what must be must be. Takin' all bets! I'm giving 9-2 on Zoidberg, the crab with the jab! The Great Red Hope! Come on, baby!"
Zoidberg, Woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop-woop.
Farnsworth, Indeed.
Bender, Says who? Was it the bugbear? Is he talking about me again?
Farnsworth," That's not Nibbler. That's my most precious possession. Leonardo's beard! I paid a fortune for it at an auction of historic body parts. I suppose if I have an Achilles' heel, it's because I bought it at that same auction."
Fry," What are you doing, darling? Get down!"
Bender," I've seen bigger. Oh, wait, I'm thinking of Eugene, Oregon. Wait. A pie with hobo-lifting aroma? Who baked it?"
Leela, Thank God!
Leela, Jackie. I guess you were right. I'm a lousy role model. I'm sorry.
Leela," Listen, this is Bender's first meal and he's a little sensitive. So let's be supportive, OK?"
Fry, I'd love to!
Fry, Well ... close enough!
Fry," Colleen wasn't satisfied with me. Were you, Colleen?"
Fry, Ow! Yay!
Fry, Hook on the hand!
Leela, Remember  Don't show any reaction to his appearance.
Hermes," You got it, mon! In fact, severely-reduced pay all around! Come on, wife, let's blow this joint!"
Bender," What is it with you kids? Every other day it's food, food, food! Oh, fine. I'll get you some stupid food."
Bender, Timber!
Zoidberg," The Magnificent Three. Scene one, take one."
Farnsworth," Oh, I'm glad you made it, Guenter because in honour of parents weekend I have a special surprise for you."
Bender," Yeah, yeah. Death's a big deal to you flesh bags. But in case you didn't notice, I'm a robot."
Fry," It doesn't matter how many human females you have, Bender's on a hot streak."
Bender," Yeah, make me famous, big head!"
Leela, I don't want any screw-ups. Use the hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow at a time.
Fry, Does it have to be nude?
Fry," Oh, my God!"
Leela, Correct.
Amy, I thought you said he didn't have hair.
Bender, Not enough room? My place is two cubic metres and we only take up 1.5 cubic metres. We've got room for a-whole-nother two-thirds of a person.
Leela," No, they're not. I saved this one. And I'm gonna raise it and care for it, so the world will forever know what it's lost. You freaking slime wad!  No. I killed it. It was the last of its kind.  Let go of me, you...   Poor thing."
Bender, And here's another one with no eyes.
Bender," This is gonna be juicy. What? Oh, man!"
Bender, Was that before or after you slept with him?
Amy, What is it with you men? Why does everything revolve around my butt?
Bender," Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I... Oops. Sorry, force of habit. I support this proposition because I love a goopy, flesh-and-blood woman, and not surprisingly, she loves me. This is a simple matter of justice, which I'm not normally for. So, please, vote yes. After all, our love isn't any different than yours, except it's hotter, 'cause I'm involved."
Fry, No. No!
Leela, To motherhood.
Hermes, Ras H. Tafari! What's goin' on here?
Fry, Yes. It's the only song I know.
Bender, Not my fault.
Bender," So I'm doomed to die? And I'll never even get to punch whoever's responsible? Oh, what's the point."
Fry," First person on Mars? I should have been the first person on Mars. He stole my clover, he stole my name and he stole my life. And now he broke my hand!"
Bender, What?!
Fry, You see? You see? Now she's bothering me when I'm at work.
Fry, Yeah but I guess I'd be angry too if I had to go to some uninhabited planet.
Leela, Fine. Hurry up.
Fry," Actually, it was five years ago. I remember 'cause they washed my socks."
Farnsworth, No! Wait! I'm afraid to die!
Leela, ...great-great-great-great-great nephew.
Fry, Hi. We have a giant stone to deliver. Sign here.
Amy, I've never been sad at a party before. I wonder if my mind is thinking about Kif being in jail.
Amy, The cat is evil! We have proof!
Farnsworth, I can afford to give away anything I want. I've won the Spanish National Lottery.
Bender, Ooh.
Bender," Sounds like a job for me, Bender."
Bender, Why does a robot need a codpiece?
Farnsworth," Thank you, Dr. Zoidberg. Hermes, incentivize that employee. As for you, Leela, I'm letting you off with a warning."
Leela, Fry? Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?
Farnsworth," What is it? Oh, jeez! Oh, man! Remarkable! A stench so foul it's right off the Funk-o-Meter. I dare say Fry may have discovered the smelliest object in the known universe."
Fry, Cool! Can I borrow the new ones? And a couple of blank tapes?
Fry," I hate the Planet of the Moochers. They take you out for a drink but when the check comes, their wallet's always in their other pants -- which they borrowed from me!"
Zoidberg," Oh! So, suddenly, Miss Goody Four-shoes over here doesn't kill anymore. She killed me not five minutes ago. What am I? Chopped liver?"
Zoidberg," Don't worry, Fry, we'll have your body all fixed up in a few days. Upsy daisy!"
Leela, And it is requested.
Fry," You might be right, Hermes."
Bender," You're watching Futurama, the show that does not advocate the cool crime of robbery."
Bender, For I was blind but now I see!
Bender, And why is the Slurm pouring into this sewer?
Fry," I don't understand. When I like something, I lick it. Like this raccoon."
Bender," Hi, I'm you from 19 seconds in the future. Stay here and wait for Fry while I go to the bathroom."
Hermes, That is quite dangerous!
Farnsworth, Nonsense. You've been my grad student for twelve years. You were ready six years ago.
Bender, Ah! Mighty fine smokable!
Farnsworth, Wait a second! Oxygen levels are rising too rapidly! 10%... 20% ...60%!
Fry, This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the chickens.
Bender, Philip Fry?
Fry," She said, ""Go!"""
Bender, Oh! How could I let this happen? I can't go through the rest of my life like this.
Bender," Hey ... so the game of cat and mouse begins, huh? Let us match wits. .... Ohhhh, how am I supposed to find him? All those times he blabbed on and on about his life in the twentieth century. If only I'd paid the slightest bit of attention. Oh well, guess I'd better go kill myself."
Amy," If I had a spray bottle, I'd give him such a spritzing."
Fry," Certainly yes us, uh-huh, sir! We've gotta bring back the kind of Xmas I remember."
Bender, Nooo!
Fry," We can definitely escape, Bender. All you have to do is bend the hatch off this steam pipe."
Fry, See?
Bender, Wretched technology has brought me nothing but misery!
Fry, That could be my beautiful soul sitting naked on her couch if I could just learn to play this stupid thing.
Amy, No.
Fry," Hey, I was nuzzling that!"
Fry," Oh, great. So what am I supposed to do now?"
Fry, Like the Kardashians.
Farnsworth, Dear God! We've got robots on the ceiling.
Leela, You're not stealing anything! Nobody hit the deck!
Fry, We wanted to show you that we really do respect your robot heritage.
Bender, Do the back dance! Do the back dance! Ooh....
Farnsworth, You favourite what? Why does my foot hurt?
Zoidberg, That's normal. Next patient.
Hermes, Then it's settled. The new chief executive officer of Planet Express corporation is That Guy.
Leela, Uh...
Amy," Greetings, Leela. I'm the Cute Witch of the North!"
Leela, It's amazing that your people can fall in love so fast.
Hermes," Mon, I'm hungrier than a green snake in a sugar cane field!"
Bender, Hooray for blind-y!
Farnsworth," Oh, dear. They'll be killed on our doorstep. And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd."
Bender," Next Thursday, you say? Pray, continue."
Bender," Take that, you twit. No! Stop it!"
Fry, Sure. When he's sober!
Fry, I know about Santa Claus.
Farnsworth," Your witness, Prosecutor Ramirez."
Leela," The sun, the sea air, good friends."
Fry, You have a boil on your butt that sings showtunes with you?
Farnsworth," Impossible! The tanker has 6,000 hulls. So, unlike me, it's entirely leak-proof. Now, once you've hauled the tanker past the protestors--"
Leela," Hey, hey! We can all fight when we're drunk. Now, listen, why don't we just brew our own beer?"
Bender," No, wait! I'm the good Santa. I've got toys ... at very reasonable prices!"
Leela, Professor!
Bender, This is so unfair!
Fry, Call technical support.
Bender," Nah, they just shot us and buried us a few times as a warning."
Farnsworth, From within.  This ship should be able to sneak undetected through the sphere's one vulnerable opening.
Bender, Would it cheer you up if I punched Fry in the groin? 'Cause I'll do it. Regardless. Body blow! Body blow!
Fry, See you in a thousand years! You owe me one.
Bender, You got it!
Zoidberg," The frenzy! Oh, the greatest experience in life and I missed it."
Fry," Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take all the help you're willing to give. I know you just want what's best for me. Ow! What was that for? Hey, come on! That hurt!"
Bender," That'll be $10,000."
Fry," B, nail, final answer!"
Farnsworth," Oh, yes, absolutely! Not a chance!"
Farnsworth," Oh, God. We've opened Pandora's fly. They'll reproduce without limit, consuming all the matter in the world."
Fry, To my friend Bender. A wise man once said he was a helluva squealer. Maybe the best there ever was.
Bender, That'll be easy. I never wear the damn thing.
Bender," Hey, Bender the Offender doesn't need you. Bender the Offender doesn't need anybody!"
Leela, Is it about my eye?
Leela, No! Everything's just--
Farnsworth," The stars are receding. Oh, the vast emptiness."
Fry," Amazing! That's why they call you ""Bender the Magnificent""!"
Fry, Hey!
Leela," Oh, come on, he's just a poor kid from the Stupid Ages."
Farnsworth," Quiet! I'm about to begin the process of reshaping Bender's body into a tender, delicate form."
Bender, Whoa! Get a load of this average-looking guy!
Fry," ""Charles de Gaulle""? Never heard of you."
Fry," Check it out, everyone. I'm back from hell and I've got the Robot Devil's hands."
Fry, No fair! Leela was training me to be captain. She even let me sit in her lap and steer -- in this comic I drew.
Bender, That answers that. Wait... Amy?
Farnsworth, They're all dead! And their bones are gone! This was no accident.
Bender, ¡Adiós! And I'm left with the real jewels safely inside... ...his compartment!
Hermes," Oh! At that rate, Planet Express will be bankrupt in... Four fingers!"
Hermes," Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also we're dying!"
Leela, Robot's don't have bathrooms.
Leela," How are you, Fry?"
Farnsworth, Oh?
Bender, Shoo! Get away! Hey! What's with the flying jerks?
Farnsworth, Give me back my floppy face!
Fry," Hello? Madfellows? I need to- Okay, Leo Wong's about to destroy the violet dwarf. So, whatever I need to know to stop him, tell me now."
Fry," What are you, Randy? A complete moron?! I'd love to talk to Bender, but I 'ave no idea where 'e is."
Bender, Your task is nearly completed. Don't let down Pharaoh now.
Farnsworth," Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot Company built a robotic Santa to determine who'd be naughty and who'd been nice and distribute presents accordingly. But something went wrong."
Fry, Now that's a tree worth chopping down.
Leela," Uh, Professor, isn't it time for your nap?"
Amy, OK! I'm happy!
Fry," Words. Nothing but sweet, sweet words that turn into bitter, orange wax in my ears."
Zoidberg," No hara-kiri today, but heiwa no dansu! The gelatinous dance of peace!"
Hermes, Are you still angry?
Bender, I'll get my kit.
Farnsworth," Leela, you ignorant dope! Now the worms will be in Fry forever."
Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down there, Sigmund. I can't stand idly by while poor people get free food. We gotta sell these things!"
Bender, Ha ha! You missed! Oh great master.
Leela, I give up! You're gonna get yourself killed and this time I won't be here to save you.
Bender, Philip J. Fry?
Leela, I don't know. I think I saved us somehow.
Zoidberg," Don't worry, I know just how to handle bullies. Just pretend like you're pathetic. Help, I'm scared. I wet myself. I'm crying like a baby and I'm soaking in pee, but what else is new?"
Leela," Bender, four and a half weeks of oil wrestling sounds like plenty."
Fry, No thanks. I just came to tell you that Zoidberg's really great. He's got male jelly coming out the wazoo.
Farnsworth, Pow. We took care of the time travel paradox.
Bender," Uh, Your Majesty, I brought the prisoners."
Leela, You know how much an apartment that big would cost on the Sun?
Fry, That's all the proof I need. Put the bottle back!
Fry," Poor, Leela. I feel like I ruined her life."
Leela, I didn't run off. I had plenty of time to finish eating and stroll away while you were kissing Amy.
Fry, That's it! We need a War of the Worlds! I'll call Orson Welles
Bender, He'll never find me in here.
Hermes, This sounds like a job for--
Fry," Tonight, that's us!"
Fry," Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long as we're here why don't we take in some exotic dancing?"
Bender, Woo-hoo! Yeah! ... Monogamous?
Fry, God help us!
Zoidberg, All eyes on Zoidberg! Ew!
Leela," OK, OK. We have one chance. Are you willing to do what I say as captain?"
Farnsworth, We're delivering a fence to keep you ladies in your place.
Bender, Yes. I guess a robot would have to be crazy to wanna be a folk singer.
Leela, Knock knock.
Zoidberg, The rotting carcass of a whale.
Bender," No, don't you see? I was a hero to broken robots 'cause I was one of them. But how can I sing about being damaged if I'm not? That's like Christina Aguilera singing in Spanish. Wait, that's it! I'll fake it!"
Fry," Seymour, cleanup! Good dog!"
Fry," She's all yours, buddy!"
Bender, and  ...hat-rack
Amy, Really?
Amy," Oh, Kiffie!"
Fry, Wow! You got that off the Internet?  In my day the Internet was only used to download pornography.
Leela, But why did you attack me?
Amy, Dad!
Farnsworth, Oh!
Bender," Supposing we're not stupid, what kinda stupid mission is this?!"
Farnsworth," Oh, dear. Oh, my. I got it. Once more."
Bender," It wasn't a bird's nest falling. That sounds like this. Aww, they're so cute when they're scared."
Leela," Fine. You'll get your cut. I don't really care about the money, anyway. I just wanna show those poor, disadvantaged orphans that they can succeed in life."
Fry," Thanks for the heads-up, Sparky."
Fry," Oh, no! Our superpower cream is out of itself!"
Zoidberg," Wait! I'll save us! By cutting the unbreakable diamond filament! Well, at least I'll die with my friends. Hello?"
Farnsworth," Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course. Anyway, whoever you all are, I have good news. You'll be making a delivery to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high gravity you'll most likely be crushed under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy!"
Zoidberg, Uh-oh!
Bender, And yet you haven't said what I told you to say. How can any of us trust you?
Zoidberg," Friends, friends, stop everything. There's food in this shaker."
Fry," Uh, is there a human doctor around?"
Fry, Um... I'll be back in a jiff. I gotta go check this comet for anarchists.
Leela, But he's not your father. That guy in the punch bowl was your father.
Fry," Huh. Did everything just taste purple for a second? Oh, well. Let's go home, you dumb poop machine."
Fry," Mom, what's my temperature?"
Leela, Mr. Peppy attacked me. Quick! Count my bones. There should be two-hundred-and-five!
Fry, It's out again.
Farnsworth," This is the greatest moment in scientific history! At last, there are no more questions left to answer!"
Fry, Pickles?!
Farnsworth, What I love most about the tentacle is that I don't need to move my bowels anymore. It's all handled by that family in Evanston.
Bender, What?
Fry," I made it, Leela. Sorry, I'm a billion years late."
Bender, Ow! And also it hurt my feelings!
Farnsworth," Good news! All these pine trees are fighting global warming by producing oxygen. Happy now, Gore?"
Amy, Will you be taking your portable filing cabinet?
Fry," Hey, Bender, I just caught a fish this big!"
Bender, Does that mean you wouldn't send me back to Earth even if I prayed to you?
Leela, It would have been nice if you'd told me you were going out with Amy.
Bender," That'll take care of those annoying rats. Now, to bake a cake so delicious they'll have no choice but to love and worship me."
Fry, What's this? This is the same toy surprise I got last time! I can't work under these conditions. And without me there is no mission. I am the mission!
Zoidberg," Then consider the following lecture a bonus  On Earth, freedom is a given. But on my planet, we have to suffer for it."
Fry, Huh. I thought you only saved the DNA of endangered species.
Fry," Hey, I did it! Wait, that's not me."
Bender," Nuh-uh! My wireless back-up unit saves a copy of me every day. So, if my body gets killed, big whoop, I just download into another body. I'm immortal, baby!"
Bender, I'll save me!
Fry," Here, take my jacket. You look a little cold."
Amy, Maybe he has. Look at these tracks.
Fry," Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how we sort of think exactly alike, and junk."
Farnsworth," The time 'as come, my friend. We have to talk about... Our arrangement."
Amy, I get it!
Amy, There aren't any copies left.
Bender," A problem that solves itself? That sounds like a job for me, Bender."
Bender," In this case ""small""!"
Fry," What about this gross, ugly, smelly loser?"
Zoidberg," What? When did this happen? You're joking, right? That's not funny!"
Bender," Whoa, slow down! This place just doesn't feel like home. It just isn't ... cosy. Ah. I can barely move! (from inside) It's perfect!"
Bender," Well, now you know. I'm not actually rich. I'm a fraud. A poor, lazy, sexy fraud. This isn't even a real bow-tie, it's magnetic."
Bender, Pft.
Fry," In exactly ten seconds, the Doomsday device will blow the stone loose. An', if my calculations are correct, it will land here on your finger."
Bender,"   Xmas tree, oh, Xmas tree! Bah-boo-bee-boo-bah-bee-boh."
Leela, No way! Forget it! I refuse to go crawling back to him!
Zoidberg," Bender, you said ""wink, wink"" out loud."
Fry," Halt, fellow robot!"
Farnsworth," And if Grandma's Xmas fruitcake finally reaches critical mass, It can be regifted straight to Santa's ass."
Fry, The moonwalk ... the robot ... the zero G.
Zoidberg, Love? That word is unknown here. I'm simply looking for a female swollen with eggs to accept my genetic material.
Hermes, Hooray! They're letting us out!
Bender," Oh, yeah? Prove it. Here, let me help you."
Zoidberg," Well it was nice of you to let me reattach your arm, Fry, especially after I made a complete eel out of myself."
Fry, Since when is the internet about robbing people of their privacy?
Leela, No.
Leela," I just like having the end locker. It's not like Amy cares about it at all. But no, she won't trade with me."
Fry," It really puts things in perspective. I mean, from up here an entire world can seem utterly insignificant."
Fry, Hand it over.
Farnsworth," How bad is it, Doctor?"
Bender," Hey, I'm snagged."
Leela," Well, I'm sure we can buy a microwave somewhere around here. Meanwhile, you guys sneak onto the army base and rescue Bender's body."
Fry, Sure I can. I learned how to handle delicate social situations from a little show called Three's Company.
Bender," Well, if you insist. But you're paying!"
Amy," Oh, that's Bender's ringtone. I recognize the smell. Hello?"
Leela," Oh, dear God!"
Bender, Hmmm. It's been twelve years. Maybe I'm getting taller.
Zoidberg," You call that an ink defense? Goodbye, friends!"
Leela," Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet Express delivery ship. We've come aboard to plead for your assistance."
Bender," But me and you like to watch together. Look, I got you a cabbage to snack on. Humans like cabbage, right?"
Bender," It's getting late. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some new heavy elements to create. Better cover your nads. It may get a little non-Newtonian in here."
Leela, So how's the old corpse? Everything hooked up OK?
Zoidberg, Nothing. Nothing at all.
Fry, Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it! Fix it!
Leela," Wow, this planetoid is completely lifeless."
Bender, You sold my body? To who?
Amy," Kif, you're so quiet. You haven't said a word all night."
Amy, Deep-fried ice cream sandwich wrapped in frosting and lightly baconed.
Leela, Why were you sneaking into my people's forbidden valley?
Amy, Wow!
Fry, I hid my seven-leaf clover in this very record jacket so my brother Yancy wouldn't get it. Here goes. It's gone! The whole place has been cleaned out! Yancy stole my clover! That thief!
Bender, Hit the deck!
Zoidberg, A feast is a feast.
Leela, Just fire the damn thing.
Leela," I say ... I'm giving up the law. And I'm giving up being single. Your Honour, will you marry me?"
Fry," Nothing is impossible. You'd know that if you really took after the Professor, like I do."
Leela," Oh, Lord!"
Farnsworth," Bad news, everyone. You're not good enough to go on your next mission."
Amy, Splech!
Leela," Fry, get up here! It's starting!"
Bender," Fry, in order for me to get busy at maximum efficiency, I need a girl with a big 400-ton booty."
Leela, Amy! Zapp! I fetched up some fresh soup!
Leela, Ugh! Just gimme the fruit cup!
Farnsworth, Something without which no ribbon-cutting ceremony could proceed. The ceremonial oversized scissors.
Zoidberg, Stay off my turf!
Bender," Have a good one! Oh, man!"
Bender," If you're strapped for cash, you might wanna consider this irregular unit. Cursed with a third ear but so full of that emotion I understand is called ""love""."
Bender," My broken friend could do it all,"
Fry," Uh, yeah. We'll have one with everything but anchovies and one with my all time favourite topping, anchovies!"
Amy, Me next snu-snu. Out me way.
Fry," Hey, Bender, here's an exhibit about Mom's favourite robot."
Fry," 78, 79, 79.50. Crud! We're 50 cents short."
Leela, Don't worry about McZongo. He an' I are having brunch tomorrow. I'm thinking of wearing this.
Hermes," Bender, are you crazy?"
Amy, Check this out  Back in 1999 the season finale of Single Female Lawyer was interrupted by technical problems. Apparently some zidiot spilled Coke on the transmitter.
Fry, Really?
Farnsworth," Very well. Eh, Cubert, fetch my drinking teeth."
Amy, Splech!  Why is Mr. Chunks doing that?
Bender," And I, I could be an acting coach!"
Bender, Help!
Bender," Yeah, why is this so important to you?"
Bender," Hear me, hear me! Stop eating Popplers! Stop eating them with honey mustard sauce. Stop eating them with tangy sweet-and-sour sauce. Stop eating the new fiesta Poppler salad. Stop taking advantage of the money-saving 12-pack. Stop enjoying Popplers on the patio, in the car, or on the boat. Wherever good times are had! Ow!"
Fry," Bender, you know robots can't go through the anomaly. Living beings only."
Leela," I wanna tell you why I didn't show up, but I can't. Just please believe me that it was a very good reason. I'm sorry I disappointed you."
Fry, Package delivery.
Amy, No!
Fry," I never thought it would end this way  Gunned down by Santa Claus. Honestly, I didn't see it coming!"
Leela, Does anyone have a lighter?
Bender," Eh, they're both fine choices. Whatever floats your boat."
Bender," Fry, what's wrong?"
Bender," Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker."
Leela, Nightfall? How can you tell down here?
Zoidberg, The doctor is in! The doctor is out!
Leela," Hermes, wait! We're having a poker party. Stay and whip off a batch of your famous jerk dip."
Bender," Alright, alright, I'll bust you out. Cheese it!"
Bender, Attack!
Bender, When will Man learn that all races are equally inferior to robots?
Farnsworth," Uh, what a pleasure it is to see my lifetime of accomplishment summed up in a 3-minute film. My best years are behind me. So much left undone. So little time."
Zoidberg, Mom! Dad! Don't ask me to choose!
Farnsworth, So he's got a little ink. Big whoop.
Bender," Row, comrades! Row!"
Leela," Also, if our identities get out, every crook in the city will be after us. Or, God forbid, our loved ones."
Leela," Yeow! Well, who does have the authority?"
Bender," Ah, quit your worrying. Thanks to my shining influence those stupid birds'll do just fine."
Fry, So this is your lair?
Bender," Yes, I do."
Farnsworth," Everything was going smoothly until right after that part I was just telling you about. Suddenly, Amanda's aunt called to say her niece hadn't received her cookie bouquet."
Fry, They're onto me!
Leela, You're not gonna eat a sandwich from a truck stop men's room are you?
Fry," Hey, Bender?"
Bender," Howdy, folks. And may I say, ""Nice work keepin' those sickos penned up."" Put 'er there. You too, buddy. An' you. An' you. An' you. An' especially you."
Fry, Come on! Remember that episode where you got high on spores and smacked Kirk around?
Bender," Actually this is extremely nice, but I really went all out on the copy. It was sorta my gift to them."
Bender, I found a pair of hermaphlamingos.
Fry," Ah, I just wish Slurms MacKenzie were here to enjoy this with me."
Leela," It's a doorbell baby! Hello, little guy. You know, I was abandoned as a baby too, so--"
Fry, We just wanted to show you that you really will be remembered.
Leela, Everyone's too polite to say anything but you're covered with bed sores.
Leela," His species must've filled the entire planet with it. Did you do that, you cute little-- Come on. That should be more than enough fuel to get us outta here. Bender, pick it up and put it in the engine."
Zoidberg," Oh, I couldn't."
Leela, An airline!
Fry, Hang on. I'm learnin' how to do loop-de-loops.
Amy," Zoidberg, you idiot, my outfit. It's, it's--"
Leela, I asked you five minutes ago.
Leela, Fry! Just give a name. You don't wanna look stupid on Court TV!
Fry, Apartment 1I. The old me would have made a joke about that!
Bender," Pick it up, people. We're enslaved here to do a job. Master? Do we have to count to three every time? Couldn't we just count to one. Or better yet one-half?"
Leela," Come on, Al, can't you let the little guy out?"
Fry, You guys are crazy. Leela doesn't need surgery. You look great the way you are.
Leela," I found a missing link. It seems to be half-man, half-toucan."
Leela," Well, someone's in a good mode."
Fry, What the...?
Leela, What are you talking about?
Fry, Look out! We're heading straight for those trees!
Bender, Wow! Thanks.
Amy, We made it!
Hermes," Bring it on, Jello-pop!"
Leela, Bender! I didn't know you liked cooking! That's so cute!
Fry, And... And then they burst out laughing a second time. I've been a delivery boy for a thousand years. Isn't there any room for promotion around here?
Fry, Far out! So there's an infinite number of parallel universes?
Fry, I wouldn't wanna do that again.
Leela," It's OK, Fry. I'm fine. I won an award today."
Bender, Now what's going on there?
Leela, It is?
Leela, Yes! I mean no! Just make sure you get my nonchalant side!
Leela," Whale oil. Bender, lift it up to the can opener."
Leela, We'll deliver that crate like professionals and then we'll go home.
Fry," Hey! This is from Miller's Outpo-- Uh, I mean, yeah, I work here alright!"
Leela, Roger!
Farnsworth," Don't tell me you actually believe in Bigfoot, you blathering ninny-hammer."
Farnsworth," I'll show that banana-swilling, poop-slinger! We just need to find that last missing link."
Fry, Sorry.
Bender, Poor flimsy humans. Don't you wish you were flawless like me? A towering inferno of physical perfection?
Fry," Uh, I can explain that. See, it used to be milk and, well, time makes fools of us all."
Amy, This isn't bad. My aunt had a place like this.
Zoidberg, You kept track of it all these years!
Bender, And a slipper on a shoe tree.
Fry," Oh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up your inhibition unit and makes you sing folk songs."
Fry," Ah, there! Perfect!"
Bender," Huh. Let me see your ass. No tattoo. Okay, you can go."
Farnsworth," Wernstrom, quit hyping your cheap Diamondillium and look at this."
Farnsworth," No, that won't restore everyone, either. Besides, I don't want my decrepit old body back! I'm running away with this invincible robot body and joining something!"
Amy," As it spins, it's producing an enormous magnetic field. If we could use that field to generate electric current, we could actually harness the Earth's rotational ener... Ener..."
Leela," Oh, if only we hadn't flown penguins to Pluto and dumped oil on them, this might never have happened. Can't we stop them from multiplying?"
Hermes, My ice cream manwich!
Bender, No other robot could have done it. It took twelve years of tireless stalking but I hunted down and killed my best friend. I'm the greatest.
Leela, There's no hurry.
Hermes," You're under a lot of guilt stress, Leela. Here, work it off."
Zoidberg," Look what arrived  My new shell catalogue. So let's try some on, already! Ah! Muy macho! Hey, gringos, here comes El Zoido to ruin your drinking water!"
Farnsworth, They pooh-poohed my electric frankfurter.
Amy, What?
Bender," It is every robot's duty to give his life for the good of humanity. Oh, crap!"
Fry," Bender, wait! This is our chance to escape, before Melllvar comes back. But we all need to work together."
Hermes, We've been walkin' for hours. I hope we can find our way back.
Fry," Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you for a minute? In private?"
Fry," Alright! It's Saturday night, I have no date, a two-litre bottle of Shasta and my all-Rush mix tape. Let's rock!"
Leela, What do you want?
Bender," Hello? Charlemagne? Plus, I bet he couldn't create a laser show with his head."
Leela," Philip Fry, the original Martian."
Fry," You're smart, you're beautiful, and best of all, you'll go out with me-e?"
Fry," I'm glad you're all here. I wanted to introduce you to my on-again-off-again girlfriend of the past thousand years, Michelle. Michelle, this is Leela. This is Bender. The Professor. Hermes and Amy."
Amy, Yay!
Amy," Oh, Kif! You're so brave!"
Leela, It's on.
Fry, It's nothing. Just a common cold.
Hermes," Sorry you wasted your life, Professor. I guess you never know everything after all."
Leela," Eg, it's putrid! What do you feed him?"
Bender," They're 60%-scaled replicas of me, Bender."
Bender, Truly a great man. Look at him up there.
Bender, No!
Fry, Why is that great news?
Hermes," Requisition me a beat. With a foot and a half of water, Everyone was alright but I cried all night, It blew my alphabet blocks out of order, And they said, ""This boy's born to be a bureaucrat, Born to be all obsessive and snotty,"" I made my friends and relations file long applications, To get into my 10th birthday party."
Leela, They have such respect for the planet.
Hermes," As long as nothing happens for the next fifteen minutes, our insurance will be reinstated, so let's just sit quietly and run out the clock."
Hermes, He's Barbados Slim And I'm Jamaican fat. Who would choose a backwards corpse With lice in his hair?
Leela, Death by brain parasite.
Fry, Uh ... sure.
Farnsworth," Well, you should've talked louder. Fortunately, I came up with a brilliant idea to save Planet Express. We'll turn it into a commercial airline!"
Fry," You mean, like, people?"
Leela," Sir, the alarm. I think I'd better--"
Bender," Yeah, uh, good luck with that."
Leela," Uh, Fry, you're in the women's steam room."
Fry, That's great!
Fry, I don't get it.
Leela, Aw! That is so true and sweet.
Bender, Hang on.
Fry," Also, that I'm not much to look at."
Zoidberg, I'll take eight!
Leela," No. You have your legacy as a brutal, tyrannical dictator, and that will outlive any monument."
Hermes, Don't worry. I have a plan.
Farnsworth, I had just built my new shipping and receiving emporium.
Leela, Come on!
Fry, Nice.
Bender," Sorry, I don't know what came over me. Let's go. I love stealing, I love taking things!"
Leela, Forget it.
Fry, That's five more times than we've won or even entered.
Bender," Guys! Guys! It's me, Bender!"
Bender, That was a good one!
Amy, Bender?
Fry," No, not yet. How 'bout we go look for the original moon landing site?"
Fry," Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted straight to Bender. If you care about Nibbler, stop caring about him!"
Fry," Quiet, Bender, you're scaring away the fish."
Bender, Uh-huh.
Bender, You do? Hmm.
Farnsworth," Oh, shut up!"
Bender," Wait! As men of science are not your minds open to new ideas? I say, do not judge me until you have tried my way of life for yourselves."
Fry," What? No. I told her to tell you that I'm... Oh, Jeep! The Dark Ones got her. It's all true. We need to talk, Leela. Then I can explain... Well, I can't explain anything, but we should talk anyway. Where are you?"
Fry," Aw, hey, c'mon, don't worry. We'll watch you clean up."
Fry," Destiny has cheated me, By forcing me to decide upon, The woman that I idolise, Or the hands of an automaton, Without these hands I can't complete, The opera that was captivating her, But if I keep them, And she marries him, Then he probably won't want me dating her."
Bender, You call that talent? Gather round old Bender and get ready for the show of a lifetime. Ta-da!
Leela, Huh. Buggalo tots?
Amy," Wow! Sporty go-cart, Leela! So hip and sexy. Not like you at all."
Fry," Hey, uh, Bender? What are we doing in this bad neighbourhood?"
Fry, But I have a date.
Leela," No, I'm just happy you were able to win a video game. Now let's concentrate on getting this desperately-needed popcorn to the people of Cineplex 14, OK?"
Amy, Us?! How can you possibly blame us?
Leela," Too bad it didn't work out with Mom, Professor."
Bender," I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out this window. Oh, dear God in heaven, they're swarming all over her."
Amy, Kif! You did it! But how did you know the dynamite would work?
Farnsworth, Whoopsie.
Bender," Oh, right. Leela's back. As if I care. Woo."
Bender, We demand that all TV's be equipped with a B-Chip that blocks Bender from appearing on the screen.
Leela, That's all? But--
Fry, Those bastards!
Leela, I'll use that free app that tells you what restaurants you're near.
Leela, Thanks. I suppose I should know your name if I'm gonna be drinking ten gallons of alcohol with you.
Leela," Well, ask Robot 1-X to pull you out."
Leela, Okay. I'll do it! To show you kids you can succeed at anything. If you just luck out hard enough.
Bender, Give me a hug.
Farnsworth, Farnsworth!
Leela," Make something up? Um... Okay. Once upon a time, there was a... A..."
Bender, But how exactly is this Happy Meal toy gonna destroy a giant death sphere?
Bender," A dog collar, for me? You shouldn't have!"
Fry, Sure.
Fry," Wait, let's go by rank."
Fry," Everything was going great. Then, all of a sudden, she's talking about hanging out. Hanging out? She's getting way too serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela."
Leela," Besides, Guenter, you're not like other monkeys. You've got the hat."
Bender, Look! Flowers! And a boat!
Leela," That's crazy. We've done nothing wrong, other than killing and dismembering the vice-president. We need to make a choice, sisters. We can either keep pestering criminals like Leo Wong with silly slogans..."
Zoidberg," Yetis? Oh, Yetis."
Fry," Eurgh! I can't believe how fat I look! Aw, Nibbler's there. Wait! What?"
Farnsworth, Let's burn these counterfeits and paddle the next swan boat the hell out of Boston.
Leela," The crystal space devil was once my brother, Prince Hiroshi."
Leela, Lobster. Want some?
Fry, Yeah!
Fry," Well, wait a second. Leela's not here yet."
Zoidberg, Craw!
Leela," Ohhhh. I'll start maybe thinking about saying ""Sure, when?"""
Bender," My arms are broken, I'll never paint again."
Fry, Neat.
Leela, You're not a tool-bot. You're not a food-motron. You're not a robot of any kind.
Fry, Wh-What? You went without me?
Bender," Ah, but what if I could put you in my fabulous bending-robot body?"
Amy," Yesh, he would."
Zoidberg," I may be the humblest Team member, but I have given it my all."
Bender," Mmm, tasty!"
Fry, I can hit a fish between the eyes from 20 yards!
Farnsworth," Why, I've been a Harold Zoid fan since back when my hips were made of bone. As it happens, I still have some of my original 78s."
Farnsworth," No, Bender! The ship can't withstand this much pressure! Sometimes it falls apart just sitting in the hangar!"
Leela," Team assembled! What is that box, you old witch?"
Hermes," Yup. What? I said no such thing, man."
Farnsworth, I've warned you not to use those things!
Farnsworth," Science cannot move forward without heaps! No, what I regret is the youth I wasted playing it safe."
Fry, What?
Amy," Help us, wooden Bender!"
Hermes, Outsiders!
Leela, You'll be back to zero soon enough.
Farnsworth," No, there wouldn't be. Most videotapes from that era were damaged in 2443 during the Second Coming of Jesus."
Fry," Oh, no, I'm boned! I haven't paid into the pension either. What'll I do when I retire?"
Bender, No crap. My grandmother was a bulldozer.
Fry," Oh, that's also for Seymour. I'm getting everything ready for when he's cloned."
Bender," Come on, don't you remember how much I was bugging you, don't you? 'Cause it was a lot, you remember, right?"
Amy," Hey, Bender! Look who's here to cheer you up."
Zoidberg, Also good.
Farnsworth," Let's see how crazy I am now, Nixon! The correct answer is  very."
Bender, Aw! You knew my favourite cause of death.
Leela," Uh, you probably don't want us to see you rehearsing, or it'll give away the ending."
Leela," Oh, God! What have I done?!"
Zoidberg," Now open your mouth and let's have a look at that brain. No, no, no, no, no, not that mouth!"
Amy," No, no!"
Amy, See ya!
Fry, Cheap lousy Lars.
Amy, He looks so natural. It's funny to think he's clammed full of sawdust and preservatives.
Fry, Bender!
Fry, He promised he'd give his Uncle Zoid a million bucks to make a movie.
Bender, No.
Hermes, We're ruined!
Leela, Icky!
Leela, What? Who are you?
Fry," Leela, we got lucky this time. But you should be more careful. I don't want anything to happen to you."
Fry," Most important of all is the big screen TV. Human families need a TV when they're eating so they don't have to talk to each other. Ah, the Earthican pastime  Blernsball!"
Leela," But the Fry I know wouldn't do that. I'm gonna call his cell phone telephone and prove you wrong.  Oh, no! Frida's been murdered!"
Zoidberg," Excuse me, if I might be so bold, I'm willing to offer my services as a bait critic. These sardines for example are bland and tasteless. And these dry, stringy night crawlers, though juicy ... ... very, very juicy--"
Bender, Alright!
Leela, Does that dummy have a brother?
Bender," Nice work, butterball. You know, I was in Italy last week."
Fry," Oh, no! The ice is melting!"
Fry," No, you can't. Shut your adorable trap!"
Leela," Now look, missy! If you don't turn around now, I'm going to have to shut down your brain."
Amy, It wasn't the goat.  All of its orifices are in use.
Leela, Keep your palms flat.
Fry, I've found her! What do I do now?
Leela, Duh. That's why we all came over here for lunch. Send.
Bender, Nah-nah! We can go...
Bender, Mostly machine. Might be a couple dead cats in there.
Leela, What?
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! We've got a delivery to the nude beach planet."
Fry," I'm no good at being a slave. I'm thinking about graduate school. Y'know, to become a barber?"
Fry," Please, don't blame Leela. She's just a little ill-bred. You know how mutants are."
Fry, The future is disgusting.
Fry," You know, my face was stuck in a pizza."
Hermes," Why are you protecting Zoidberg, Professor? Do you owe him something?"
Leela," Well, it was a spectacular battle but there doesn't seem to be any permanent damage."
Leela," It looked like you were just sitting there, but whatever."
Hermes, All I'm askin' is for you to go back in time to when I still had my body and bring it back for me.
Leela, Not the Civil War private. We’re reinacting the Sith-il War.
Bender," Damn you, old man!"
Leela, For one hundred quatloos  Who did the captain maroon on Ceti Alpha V?
Bender," Professor, I want you to look these poor floozies in the eye and tell them their oil wrestling days are over."
Leela, Uh ... I think I'll go check on Bender.
Fry," Just out of curiosity, we could use the cards to buy gum, then immediately quit the army, right?"
Fry, God bless America.
Leela, Pass the blowhole.
Leela," Stay back! Or we'll, beat the tar out of you ... using superpowers!"
Farnsworth, Yes?
Bender," Hey, buddy. I'm looking for fresh slug."
Fry," Who are you, old man?"
Bender, I'm gettin' on the bus!
Fry," What? That's not fair. I deserve the same respect any other college dropout gets. By God, I'm gonna enroll here at Mars University and drop out all over again!"
Farnsworth," Forget it, I'm not going! I have my reasons! Shut up, all of you!"
Zoidberg, I hate to see it come to an end. When will it end?
Fry, You can't even keep up with me and I'm some sort o' stone-age throwback.
Fry, Nothing like a power nap.
Bender," How 'bout ""Blotto""? It's gritty, it's got street cred. Plus I can keep my monogrammed slippers."
Leela, Yes.
Leela," Maybe later. I-I mean, I don't know what to ask about."
Leela, Would not!
Leela," Yeah. If you believe the listing agent. Anyhow, one day, the princess went off to... Uh... Tell a story! And, then, that's exactly what she did do that. And they all lived happily ever after. The end."
Leela, Sure. The kids at the orphanarium used to do it all the time.
Amy, It's so huge! How big does one o' those things get?!
Leela," Yes! That! A... One-eyed princess in a long, flowing... Tank top. And she lived in a magical, one-room..."
Leela, I'll just have something from the lite menu. How about the gardener lover's salad?
Fry," Sir, I'm outfitting an expedition to a monastery high in the Himalayas. I'll need a long-sleeved coat."
Leela," Yeah, it is."
Farnsworth, I said science!
Bender, Saw it comin'!
Bender," Come on, Captain."
Leela," Oh, dear! I seem to have warped my fork! Could you bend it back for me? Billy?"
Leela, Punishment?
Farnsworth," Relax, Fry. Everyone we ever knew died thousands of years ago."
Farnsworth, My God! Why would Leonardo's machine's brought us here?
Fry, Poor Bender. Says here to tell his friends he's at a spa.
Bender," Hey, guys, quit reminiscing and grab me two cigars."
Fry, No! Mr. Peppy just wants to be our friend.
Fry, I just have to sign Leela's birthday card. How do you spell XO?
Bender, So they sent a helpless child to kill me? Well I'm not going out without a fight.
Leela, There aren't any Pandas in New New York.
Hermes, Proud of you? You ruined us with sleazy business practices and a complete disregard for human decency. Of course we're proud of you!
Fry," Well, I guess that sounds OK."
Fry, Nothing good.
Fry, Anyone who laughs is a Communist!
Amy, Yes.
Leela," Fry, this stuff was garbage when it was new. Let's blow it up already!"
Zoidberg," By a scallop's forelocks! What's with all the beer, Fry?"
Leela," I don't know, I don't know. It's not an easy decision. If only I had two or three minutes to think about it."
Bender, No. It's inhabited by robots!
Zoidberg," Hooray, Zoidberg escaped! Hooray, Zoidberg loves the tentacle!"
Hermes, I maintain a cubicle here for weekend getaways.
Leela," Oh, my God!"
Bender," That's what makes it so funny! OK, he wasn't joking. Now shut up and follow me."
Bender, I think she means 10 wins on the gay circuit.
Leela, You're just saying that because he bought you that antique robot toy.
Bender," Well, this is just great! What's the point of living if I can't say ""ass""? Hey, I didn't blow up! Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass! Alright! I'm back in the saddle!"
Leela, I wanna enlist. My friends always die if I'm not there to save them.
Fry," Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis myself."
Hermes, You'll have to be respectful. This customer is fifty-feet tall and sensitive about his appearance.
Farnsworth, This is Vergon 6.
Fry," Aw, man!"
Fry," Psst. Leela, wanna join the Mile-Deep Club?"
Fry, Hey! That's my patented space hook! You stole it!
Fry, Hey! A phone booth! I can call my nephew. Wow! A real live robot! Or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
Farnsworth, It's the event of the scientific season. Every member presents an invention and the best one wins the Academy prize.
Leela, Bender! I feel bad enough already.
Bender, That's a complete load.
Leela, A week would be a little much.
Bender," Uh, can people who hate Star Trek leave?"
Bender, You old lunatic! How you been?
Farnsworth, Perhaps we should reconsider the girly calendar.
Bender, Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?
Bender," And you wanna defend Zoidberg? Are you familiar with the old robot saying ""does not compute""?"
Leela," Did you approve that awful ad, Fry?"
Fry, You know it!
Zoidberg," Look, friends! I accidentally learned to tap-dance!"
Hermes, So much for that.
Farnsworth, Tell them I hate them.
Bender," I got plans. I'm gonna turn my on/off switch to ""off""."
Fry, You want a banana?
Amy, I thought I set you for 7 15!
Leela," It's very simple. If it's alive, don't lick it."
Bender, This seems like a nice future. Let's just stay here. We can settle down on that mountain of skulls.
Leela, You're you. That's all I need to know.
Amy, Aha!
Leela," Dr. Zoidberg, how can you claim to love freedom and then enslave all of Earth?"
Leela, Doesn't it bother you even a little to be taking advantage of your girlfriend's trust?
Fry," You can't give up hope just because it's hopeless. You gotta hope even more and cover your ears and go ""blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!"" I'd also like a pack mule."
Leela, Doingg! Don't lick things that don't wanna be licked.
Leela," Relax, you babies. It's no different from stomping a puppy."
Farnsworth," Oh, I've failed again."
Zoidberg," It mimics the symptoms of hypermalaria exactly. Except for the part where, instead of dying, you turn into a Yeti! Wow! Hold 'im down while I prepare the antidote."
Hermes, We've decided to do the merciful thing and have you euthasised.
Fry, That sounds hard.
Bender," Hey, the guy's dead! There's no law against grave robbing."
Zoidberg, And all we need is a little spine supplement to replace what Leela lost in that unavoidable saw mix-up.
Bender," Zuban tobacco?! The richest, most obnoxious kind! Listen, pal. I'm lookin' for a versatile smoke. One that's equally good in a crowded elevator or an audience with the Pope."
Fry," Don't feel bad, sir. It's not your fault. You probably just inherited your appearance from your mother."
Bender, ...Just 'cause I can't cook you ham and eggs...
Farnsworth," I probably should have told you. Anyway, the important thing is to be relaxed tomorrow."
Bender," Good news, Leela. I landed the contract to empty all the spittoons in Little Italy."
Zoidberg, I lied.
Bender, It's hopeless. We might as well turn in my head for the five cent deposit.
Leela, Say again?
Fry," Y'know, I'm the luckiest guy in the whole future. I've been given a second chance and this time I'm not going to be a total loser. What's that?"
Leela, Goodbye-ee!
Leela," One spoonful to calm me down. OK, I've got a pretty good calm going! Two spoonfuls to help me sleep. Uh-oh, still awake. I guess one more spoonful couldn't hurt. Oh, my gosh! I'd better get a sponge. Fry? Is that you? I don't need a sponge!"
Bender," Ooh, yeah! C'mon--"
Zoidberg, You had to drag spines into this!
Zoidberg," I'll handle the snipping. After all, I do have the proper equipment."
Bender," Yeah, Leprechaun Universe is fine ... if you haven't seen Pirate Universe!"
Fry, Leela!
Fry, You were mean and you yelled and you made us do all that work.
Hermes," Okay, then. Leela, Amy, come to work topless tomorrow."
Leela," OK, check the guidebook."
Leela, Didn't you have ads in the 20th century?
Bender, Yes! I got the most! I win Xmas!
Farnsworth," And, um, that's why I believe I deserve the Nobel Prize."
Fry," So long suckers! Uh, hello suckers!"
Hermes," They have phones in booths now? Finally, I don't have to lug this cellphone around."
Leela, Can't we just shoot a missile at it?
Zoidberg," For you, my friend, anything."
Fry, I'll tell you when my horse finishes ... bad.
Leela, Please?
Leela," Uh, I suppose so."
Fry," I need cheering up, Bender.  I dunno.  You wanna go out and party tonight?"
Farnsworth," Choke on that, causality!"
Fry, Uh-oh! Nibbler died in the wall.
Bender," Lay it on us, big boots."
Fry, Unless you let us live. Then you'll get off scot free.
Fry, Sorry. Never mind.
Fry, Miniskirts? That sounds familiar.
Zoidberg," Well, I guess this is goodbye for me as well."
Bender," Sure is shocking about the Professor, huh?. And now Hermes is mysteriously missing. Anyhow, it doesn't affect me, Bender. Hey, what's this? Hermes' dreadlocks? And his arm?  Leela, I'm shocked. Food goes in the disposal, hair and flesh go in the trash!"
Zoidberg, Okay.
Farnsworth," Oh, how could I have put that bomb timer on upside-down? I could swear I followed the manual precisely. I'm a dried up husk of a scientist. This is all my fault."
Amy," Are you off your rocket? Your parents are mutants. It's illegal for them to come above ground 'cause they're inferior genetic scum. Uh, present company excluded, of course."
Leela, Everybody grab a club.
Farnsworth," Cover that fireplace, confound you! I've only a few years to live. I don't wanna spend them dead."
Bender," OK, OK, we get the point."
Zoidberg," Wonderful. And while you're under the knife, you could also get an ink pouch to help you escape your enemies."
Fry," So, is it true that alligators flushed down the toilet survive down here?"
Bender," No liquor? Do svidaniya, comrade!"
Fry, It worked!
Leela, What message?
Fry, Poop! Poop!
Leela," OK, crew, listen up. Your job is to delivery these 40 pillows to that hotel."
Bender, Stealin' is a form of creativity!
Fry," Yeah. If you rule out every guy with a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an explosive violent temper, of course you're gonna be lonely."
Fry, My God. He's like some kinda believable Hulk!
Fry," Hi, Leela! I'm just gonna keep talking, even if you can't hear me. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
Leela, This can't go on. Today is the day we fight back!
Fry, What a nightmare!
Fry, Bender! No!
Leela, That's it. They've gone too far. It's time to fight back.
Leela," OK Bender, we're here. It's time to get to work."
Fry," Professor, something's bothering me."
Leela," Did you drive much in the 20th century, Fry?"
Farnsworth," Oh, it's 2.30. We can still catch the early bird dinner special."
Fry," Because when we're together in here, baby, time will stand still."
Leela, I'll go get some more bricks.
Amy," Hey look, now they gotten bigger."
Leela," So, once more we meet again."
Fry," Alright, don't get your panties in a knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly."
Fry, Where am I?
Leela, OK. We just have to get from here to the escape pods.
Bender, You betcha!
Bender," Well, that was dumb."
Bender," Hey, dean, nice looking model."
Leela, We're home.
Leela, Hi-yah!
Bender," No, he ain't any of the eight people I ever met."
Fry," Oh, it's Bender's apartment. He put in carpeting yesterday so now my head hits the ceiling. Hey, do you realise you're standing at a weird angle? Now you're OK."
Leela, I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her.
Amy," A gigantic spherical generator, one that could provide unlimited energy, because it's essentially in Perpetual Motion."
Farnsworth," Action Delivery Force, assemble!"
Bender," Congratulations, Fry, you snagged the perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she's probably got other characteristics."
Amy," That's OK, Hermes. At least we have you back."
Zoidberg, Hello? I'll take eight!
Leela, A fashionable tank top. And designer boots ... encrusted with jewels.
Leela, That's cute!
Bender, I meant ass whiplash.
Bender, A little.
Leela," Planet Express Ship, is something wrong?"
Amy, Hey! You're springing for Lightspeed? Pretty ritzy!
Farnsworth," Not on the same channel, of course."
Leela, Zapp Brannigan.
Bender," There's a band of river trolls living in the moat and they may have no intention of letting us out of this castle, unless we hand over the Golden Scepter of Zanthor."
Farnsworth," Ah! Cartilage! Dude, I bid you a fond cowabunga! I'm off to laugh at the Reaper. Look out, world, here I... I'm sorry, Amy, but your body is not up to the task. Also, I don't care for these boobs flapping every which way. Now quit your bologna-gargling and let's switch back to our original bodies."
Zoidberg," Mmm, I haven't eaten since Tuesday! Bird eggs, animal slices ... ... dry woven reeds! All gone! Can I drive?"
Leela," After a whole life of searching, I may finally have found where I belong."
Bender," Oh, God, I'm not gonna get my medals! They're all I have to remember my Olympic career. Wait, I've got it! Professor, make a woman out of me!"
Leela, Thanks. It's so nice to wake up and see—
Bender, Uh-oh.
Amy, Two.
Farnsworth, This is for Big Bertha. That is not what I meant to give you for Big Bertha.
Fry, Ooh! What's this?
Farnsworth, My disintegrator ray really works!
Fry, Leela's fine. But my jaundice has progressed a Muppet gangrene. It's not easy being gangrenous.
Farnsworth," I'm glad you're so brave in the face of the unknown, Leela. Because, for your next mission, you'll be flying directly through... The Bermuda Tetrahedron!"
Farnsworth," But we can use those very gases to save the planet. If you all vent your exhaust directly upward in one burst, it should thrust the Earth further from the sun, thus cooling it. By my calculations, we'll need the full force of every last robot. So, quickly, everyone point your exhaust vents straight upwards. Now vent! Vent like the wind! Harder! Harder!"
Bender, Pft! Forget that. I say the whole world must learn of our peaceful ways. By force!
Bender, Whatever.
Hermes, It's an old Jamaican accounting tradition. We burn his timecard. That way his zombie doesn't come back looking for his final paycheck.
Bender," Kids, meet the jerkbags I work with."
Bender, All in.
Bender," Thanks a lot, Takei, now everybody knows!"
Amy, We just released an endangered animal back into the wild. A bone vampire!
Bender," Everyone we ever knew? Nah, I never liked those guys."
Fry, Did you build the Smellescope?
Fry," I wish I could go with you, pal."
Fry, Bender! It's a miracle! Ow!
Leela, Good for you. Can we go home now?
Leela," Well, see you back at the office. And don't forget to tell your Mom you love her."
Fry, Space pirates?
Farnsworth," We have only one hope, Mr. President. We must encase the entire planet in a protective sphere of my patented, ultra-hard Diamondium!"
Bender, Neat!
Bender," Yeah, but the rents are outrageous. Why don't you just come move in with me?"
Hermes, And I brought a few seeds of my own.
Leela, Me ... feel ... a bit better in cognitive faculties.
Zoidberg," Even in a depression, the entertainment industry thrives."
Leela," Thanks, Professor. But I don't want the treatment."
Bender, That's my mama!
Hermes, Like a sexy Yogi Berra!
Hermes," What in the name of Bob Marley's ghost? Get to work, you lazy boat bag!"
Farnsworth," In fact, most of them died from their injuries."
Fry, You're the last store open. I need something for my friend Leela. Just give me your best animal.
Farnsworth," Remarkable! According the high-precision digital chronograph it's July 9th, 1947, which would explain why the chronograph has turned into this pin-up calendar."
Bender, All right. I'll need accomplices.
Leela, That's stupid!
Leela, They used to be such peaceful birds. I suppose this was your doing.
Fry," Oh, my God! The old Planet Express ship."
Fry," But Professor, you time traveled yourself, remember, when we went back to Roswell?"
Fry," Here's the entrance. From this moment on, I declare my bad luck officially over."
Farnsworth, I was using that!
Bender," And all without killing anyone. This gang's got some fresh, new ideas. I admire that."
Bender," Body switcher, eh? Mayhap the heist is back on. Who needs accomplices, if I can just use their bodies."
Fry, This is it. My Ronco Record Vault. I still remember the combination  Three. It's stuck!
Bender," Ho, ho-- Ow!"
Leela," Oh, for the love of Benji!"
Farnsworth, For Slurms!
Farnsworth," What's our depth, Captain?"
Amy, He knows when you are sleeping.
Bender, What's that black cracker?
Leela," If you were my kids, you'd get quite a talking to ... from your father ... when he got home from the Senate."
Leela," Once and for all, Fry, even though it's the future, most objects are still just objects. Not Aliens who look like objects."
Bender," Dream on, skin tube. I'm only programmed to bend for constructive purposes. What do I look like, a de-bender?"
Fry, What a nice lady!
Leela, I don't know. Usually when I do stuff like this the ship moves.
Leela," Well, yes, technically. But it's still very sweet of you."
Leela, Here!
Farnsworth," And you, Cubert! I cloned you from one of my warts and I can send you straight back in there."
Hermes, Oh! I'll never pass inspection now. They'll bust me lower than a limbo stick ... at carnival time. And that's as low as limbo sticks get.
Leela, It's not working! He's drawing straight from our weapons.
Leela, What exactly are those made of?
Fry," Dr. Zoidberg, why is everyone acting so weird?"
Farnsworth, We're not seeing it again! Ask something less stupid.
Bender, Fine! I'll be in my quarters appreciating controversial artworks.
Farnsworth," Who's there, Hermes? Is it visitors? I want to see them."
Bender, There! Now no one will be able to say I don't own John Larroquette's spine.
Hermes," Oh, my God!"
Fry, Yuck!
Fry," You're right, Amy! Maybe I do need some fresh air."
Bender," Go on, get out of here before you get caught."
Bender, Where are we delivering it to?
Fry, I'll get us out of here.
Farnsworth, See you then!
Farnsworth," I don't care. Listen well  No matter what happens, no matter how great your curiosity, you are forbidden to look in this box. Forbidden! Pretty tantalising though!"
Zoidberg," Hooray, hooray."
Bender, Why don't you just use a potted plant like Fry?
Fry, Whoa! What are you doing?
Fry," Oh, yeah? Then what about this?"
Bender, We can't! There's no George Washington nor any other Presidents.
Leela, I can.
Farnsworth, Oh! Why couldn't my disgraced ancestor have lived in the NASCAR era?!
Fry, 'Cause you're too ugly to be a wart.
Amy," Yes, you should!"
Leela, What do you people want?
Hermes, It's the only collar they had in stock at Office Depot.
Amy," Well, let's earn some bread."
Fry, Ooph!
Fry, Wow! That would be impressive if you were a Human!
Leela, Never.
Fry," I hope it's a lager so I can take it to a ball game. Ooh, I felt that one!"
Fry, Cutting Leela's head off won't solve anything!
Farnsworth, That's not what happened! Shut up and go live with your parents.
Farnsworth, Huh? You were gone?
Leela," Oh, thank you."
Farnsworth," No, and you don't need to see this."
Bender, I bet he's up in Robot Heaven right now. So he won't miss his eyes.
Leela," I'm all for a good beating, but you'll never find him. Product inspectors are bureaucrats, faceless bean counters who blend into the woodwork."
Hermes, Welcome to the world of business!
Leela," You're vegetarians, who cares what you do?"
Fry, Just as well. I'm getting tired of this wood show.
Farnsworth, We'll start with that one.
Bender, Don't wake up Fry.
Zoidberg, Because our friend Francis here is in reality... A bad murderer.
Bender," Mom! It's me, Bender. Look at me! I want attention. Hey, ho!"
Leela, I dunno. Don't I need a degree to write gibberish for toddlers?
Fry," Man, we've been skipping for hours. I need to pull over and take the wiz."
Bender," Nah, I'm trying to watch my input. I need plenty of wholesome, nutritious alcohol. The chemical energy keeps my fuel cells charged."
Amy," Psst, look what life was like before genetic engineering."
Leela, No.
Fry, You think? 'Cause I always kinda wished that--
Bender," OK, OK, keep your space pants on. I'll take care of this."
Bender," Very well. Let there be light. I got it! I got it! Um, when you're writing the Bible, you might want to omit that last miracle."
Farnsworth," Yes, that's a capital idea. Let's all go register!"
Bender, I don't feel like drinking.
Hermes," Hooray, Professor!"
Zoidberg, I can't pay.
Fry, We are cleared for takeoff.
Fry," That stinks, Professor. Too bad the universe made it turn out that way and not some other way. I wonder why it did that."
Bender," Oh, boy! I feel like a car in a candy store!"
Fry, Hmm. So I guess you'll wanna see my Fry Hole.
Farnsworth," Great Scott, a Tricycle-tops!"
Bender," Lousy, stinking rip-off! Well, I didn't have anything else planned for today. Let's go get drunk!"
Fry, Wait a second. Power. Liquid coolant. That gives me the option of electrocution or drowning.
Fry, Everything?
Fry," So, what's your plan to recognize it?"
Leela," Too bad Nibbler's not around. I guess I'll have to eat this raw, dripping ham by myself. Nibbler? Nibbler, you're scaring me. Nibbler? Am I going crazy? Have my years of wild hedonism finally caught up with me? Nibbler, help! Don't leave me here. Uh, Nibbler? Could you scooch the seat up just a little bit?"
Bender," Ah, don't blame me, Blame my upbringing!"
Leela, We'll do it.
Fry, No fair! I saw it first!
Leela," I would never abandon a helpless animal. Y'know, Zapp, once I thought you were a big, pompous buffoon. Then I realised that inside you were just a pitiful child. But now I realise that outside that child is a big, pompous buffoon!"
Fry, Right.
Fry, The tentacle monster is about to address the world. It's too serious.
Farnsworth, Uh-huh. May I come in?
Bender, Nothing. I guess I'm just going to have to get used to being half a robot.
Bender," Uh, nothing!"
Leela, Well you were sure right about Flexo being evil.
Hermes, Say what?!
Bender, I do love inconveniencing the underclass.
Amy, That's different.
Fry," Call me a ""booger blaster""! I'll blast a booger so hard that--"
Farnsworth, Defend the fire!
Leela, No! Put that back and turn it on!
Farnsworth, It's so you can't keep your ball at the end of the game.
Bender, I'll tell you ... with my final breath.  I came here with a simple dream  A dream of killing all humans. And this is how it must end? Who's the real 7-billion-ton robot monster here? Not I. Not I.
Zoidberg, Let me just peel your head a little and see if I can get that skull out.
Bender," Aren't you the Donbot, head of the Robot Mafia?"
Farnsworth, That a girl!
Farnsworth," It's very simple. The ad gets into your brain just like this liquid gets into this egg. Although, in reality, it's not liquid, but gamma radiation."
Bender," Listen to me, Leela  I'm an expert at not caring. The secret is to stop giving a rat's ass about anyone else and start thinking of the things that you want, that you deserve, that the world owes you."
Leela, What is it? Is it about Bender?
Fry, You mean he's--
Hermes, Alright then.
Hermes, Item one... Duck!
Leela, All systems operational. Let's rock!
Leela," Well, at least you saved us from, uh, you. Thank God you finally overcame your incompatibility with Robot 1-X."
Fry," Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery."
Bender," Well, looks like that wraps everything up in a nice big, old, fat sack of..."
Leela," I'm sorry, kids. I'm not a natural storyteller. But I promise  I'll make up a better story and come back again."
Leela, Protestors?
Bender," Look, it's that crate we were gonna throw in the sewer."
Fry," Well, anyway, just remember that people care about you."
Amy, I don't know what to do. Do you think I should eat more butter?
Fry, No! It's not like that. Everyone gets his own room and a shelf in the refrigerator.
Fry, Sure. There's just one thing I want you to do.
Bender, Shut your fat mouth!
Amy," Professor, it worked! You look young enough to be my father!"
Bender, Yeah!
Bender, You do? Really?
Farnsworth, Look at him. I'm so proud.
Farnsworth," And so, as you and Leela kissed goodbye in a tender display of toungesmanship, we plunged into a massive wormhole. Never to be seen again."
Bender," Boy, who knew a cooler could also make a handy wang coffin? Hey, uh, mind if I stick these in here?"
Hermes," It's been a terrible year, people. The company is on the verge of bankruptcy."
Farnsworth," A common— A common cold?! No! No! Ever since Fry first came to us, I've lived in mortal terror that this would happen!"
Fry, These toys soldiers are poorly painted.
Farnsworth, Have you ever dissected a Yeti before?
Bender," Don't ask where I was last night. For all you know, I was at home, perhaps baking a strudel. What's her problem? Somebody die or something?"
Farnsworth, Powering up Clone-O-Mat. Placing fossil on the Plat-Clone-O-Form. Initiating dog brain CAT scan.
Leela, Then we have no choice. We'll have to mercy-kill the Professor ourselves.
Bender, Is too!
Leela, Get him!
Amy, Let's get liquored up!
Fry," Sorry, I overslept."
Fry, Wow! Mining a comet! That sounds fun.
Fry, This is wrong. We shouldn't have abandoned them there.
Fry, But--
Fry," Aw, relax, buddy. You were probably just shooting some big, fuzzy craps."
Fry, Don't do it!
Amy, I thought it was an auction.
Farnsworth," Hmm, I believe I can fashion a slingshot using this robot wishbone and this elastic from my pants."
Farnsworth," Welcome, everyone. What a pleasure to see so many miserable faces."
Leela, But—
Bender," I'm sorry, buddy. At least we'll die on our backs, helpless. Huh? What the hell are you doing? Hey, you trying to make me look bad? Aha! I'm even greater than I thought I was! And now to fulfill my destiny."
Zoidberg, Oy. I lost another one.
Bender," Bite my shiny metal ass! Ooh, yeah! C'mon, baby! Come on! Yeah!"
Leela, There's so much information and yet somehow I feel as if I know it all already.
Zoidberg," Hear my words. My shell may be tough like a samurai honeymoon mask, but inside I'm as soft and sensitive as a girl made of custard!"
Fry," Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?"
Bender," It was awful. I tried helping them, I tried not helping them but in the end I couldn't do them any good. Do you think what I did was wrong?"
Bender," Nonsense. It's exactly like me. Flexo  The fun-loving love machine Fembots love to love. Hey, barkeep, I'll have a Fuzzy Navel and she'll have the girliest drink in the house."
Zoidberg," Sure, humans are cute, but how else are we supposed to test cosmetics?"
Leela," I'll get my coat. Let's go, Bender."
Bender, That's it. I'm killin' myself!
Bender," And then Calculon said, ""No!"""
Leela, It's just that I get tired of Fry always only thinking of himself.
Bender," Thank you, and goodnight."
Farnsworth, Don't do what? Don't use this memory ray so I can remember what happened back then?
Hermes," Might I have one too, wife?"
Leela," And, Bender, that aerosol head spray makes your antenna smell nice--"
Hermes, That's a very good question.
Bender, Yep.
Leela," OK, Fry, here's the package to deliver. And for once in your life be careful. This is my first visit to the Galaxy of Terror and I'd like it to be a pleasant one."
Leela, You're just jealous!
Bender, Wow! Ow!
Fry, Erth.
Leela," Bender? My God, you're a mess!"
Bender," Truly, they were as gods who built this place!"
Leela," You're making fun of our ship? Your ship is the most beat-up thing I've ever seen, and I've seen Mickey Rourke's head."
Bender, Oops.
Fry, I'm real sorry I missed the mission. I wasn't there and you might have needed me.
Farnsworth," Is he badly hurt, Dr. Zoidberg?"
Leela," Thank you, Jrrr. I hope you'll always think of me as your mom."
Fry, Wow. You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb?
Bender, Eight bucks.
Fry," It's okay, Amy. I don't have a fancy degree either, but today I'm a prominent boy in the package delivery field."
Bender," Wait, wait, wait, wait. What is it you like best about me?"
Bender," This is a stick-up. Gimme the bag, old man!"
Bender, I'm not sitting through one more PTA meeting. The kids have got to go!
Bender," Oh, it was nothing."
Leela," We will not let you implode the violet dwarf star at galactic coordinates 167.84, -58.03, mark 948."
Fry, Leela! He could live another 100 years!
Leela, Blernsday Night Blernsball!
Fry, My tummy hurts!
Leela, Look! The asteroid. Now it's crawling with life. Like Zoidberg's sandals!
Bender," Heck! Those guys hate fire! I gotta do something. What the--? Termites? Well, I don't need legs to save my friends. I'll just use the old extentromatic arms!"
Fry, I almost feel like we should do something to help her.
Leela, They are my parents.
Bender, Where'd I go just now?
Amy, Do you eat these dummy tin-wrapped chocolate coins?
Leela, I've lost control of the ship!
Bender," Nah, you can't blow the smoke from such a majestic stogie in just anyone's face. I'm saving it for the fancy-pantses at Zapp Brannigan's black tie reception. You comin'?"
Bender, Well I'm glad we got all that out in the open. We'll just let ourselves out.
Fry," Ooh, this is real futuristic!"
Fry, But I thought the Mom Store was across town.
Hermes," I did it! I saved Earth and won back my woman. Right, woman?"
Fry, I look like an idiot who can handle those feministas.
Amy, I just wish a decent guy would call me instead of this spleeze-ball who has me too terrified to even answer the phone. Hello?
Bender, I told you it's an audition!
Bender, Lies! Lies and slander!
Fry," Whoa, whoa, wait a second. You mean Bender is the evil Bender? I am shocked. Shocked! Well not that shocked."
Hermes," Sweet kookaburra of Edinburgh, Professor. You sure you know how to fly this thing?"
Bender," So, Bender, is something wrong? Who said that? Oh, it was me! 'Cause my roommate doesn't notice or even care that I'm upset!"
Leela, You're a lucky man. But are they way more expensive than regular eggs?
Bender," Aye aye, Captain. It appears that Flexo has outwitted us all. Especially me ... Bender."
Leela, Step aside turkey-neck. I think I know the code.
Amy, Later.
Fry," Ooh! A Bot Mitzvah. Shalom, hunger! Shalom, free food!"
Fry, So you're saying these aren't the decaying ruins of New York in the year 4000?
Fry," Now say ""nuclear wessels""!"
Bender," Yep, everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender."
Leela, I don't wanna spoil the party but we're all job deserters now. We're unemployed and we have nowhere to go.
Fry," Of course. The gorilla was the 18th hole, so we're headed into the ball return."
Leela, I kind of hoped this whole experience would have left you a little more open to your sensitive side.
Bender, Someone fat get in my way! I'm broken again. I can't move any part of me.
Farnsworth, Not what we're looking for. Throw it in the soup!
Leela, Prepare to storm the surface for the Million Mutant March.
Amy, Well globviously! But if they liked you then I wouldn't. Don't you know anything about girls?
Bender," Wait, I'm not in position."
Leela," Uh, no."
Fry," Well, that won't work, remember? We only have three women on staff—"
Leela, No!
Farnsworth, Wha?! You're not my breakfast friends! What are you doing here?!
Fry," Don't you worry about Planet Express. Let me worry about ""blank""."
Fry," Seriously, I can't think of anything. Gotta find something to make me think. Hardy Boys, too easy. Nancy Drew, too hard. Aha! Perfect! Bonfire of the Vanities!"
Zoidberg," Bah, big shots. I say let the dice do the talking."
Zoidberg," Money doesn't make good people, no, siree!"
Fry, Bender rules!
Amy," OK, thanks."
Bender, We are not amused.
Bender, I know. But I just missed Nibbler so much.
Fry, This was the storage room. My dad spent years turning it into a bomb shelter.
Farnsworth, Evolution is under attack in our schools? To the science mobile.
Leela, Uh-huh. Now tell us she's witty and sophisticated.
Leela, Be it parsnips or peppers or kale or zucchini.
Leela," Fry, no! He's bulging with what could be muscles. Ooh!"
Fry, What makes it so great?
Bender, The key is knowing precisely where to strike. Oops!
Fry, Turn it over.
Fry," Leela, we're missing the premiere. My only goal in life was to attend a Hollywood shindig. Just pay the valet the two bucks."
Fry," Gosh! My old neighbourhood. That's the bench where I found some shirts! That fire hydrant! In summer we'd light it on fire! On that corner, some guy with a bushy beard handed out a socialist newsletter!"
Leela, What are we supposed to do now?
Leela," They are now. In the 2600's, New Yorkers elected a super-villain governor, and he stole most of the world's monuments."
Fry," Uh, work really, really hard?"
Fry, A gun?!  D-Do I really need to—?
Bender, I'd like to give Robot 1-X a big smooch on the-- Hey! What's the dealy-o?
Fry," Silence! I have traveled far and seen deep, and I have come to know the purpose of our existence."
Farnsworth," When the time code duplicates a living thing, the copy is always doomed. And that includes flabby Jamaican potbellies."
Bender, Wohoo! Just like med school!
Farnsworth," And you broke mine. Granted, that was four or five hearts ago."
Amy, The Martian muck leech.
Fry, Where's the hole?
Leela," Hey, if your engines work--"
Fry," A movie. A movie, ma'am."
Leela," Alright! Cool your jets, hotshot."
Leela, Is there Mrs. Queequeg?
Farnsworth," I don't care, they all pay the same."
Leela, What are we delivering?
Bender," Shut up, I'm billing you by the hour! Besides, I'm a robot, they'll listen to me. Ladytrons and gentlebots..."
Fry," You idiot, frozen me's still got a wallet full of old timey money."
Fry, I don't know. Wait. What's that about a secret society?
Leela," Professor, maybe I can help you get even with Mom. I spend most of my time thinking about how to get revenge on a bad boss."
Fry, Is it done?
Leela," Alright, this is the third hose fight I've broken up today and the second one using actual hoses. Now move your lazy asses and start scrubbing the ship like I ordered you to."
Fry," A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human!"
Bender," Yes, anything less than immortality is a complete waste of time!"
Fry," Hey, Leela. Mmm. What smells saturated?"
Farnsworth," 4 00 in the evening? Then, good night."
Fry," Hmm, sporty!"
Leela, I'm in.
Zoidberg, Now if the deceased would kindly take his place of honour.
Bender, What?
Fry," Especially ""commune."" Come on, it's the fate of the universe, puff it up a little. Like you could say your ancient order is sensing deep upheaval in the cosmic life energy field."
Leela, Bender!
Farnsworth, No! It's humiliating and degrading to Leela!  Play it ten more times!
Farnsworth," Congratulations, Deathballers! We've won the right to explore the anomaly!"
Fry, He's dead.
Fry," Yeah, it's like we feel the same way about junk and stuff, or, whatever."
Bender, Thanks. Here's your finger back.
Farnsworth," It's not snagged, the mechano man has caught something! Sweet Zombie Jesus! It's huge!"
Fry, Good work.
Fry," And then, while they sat helplessly around the campfire ... a demented knife-wielding escaped lunatic libertarian zombie mutant snuck up and--"
Farnsworth, But what about your super-intelligence?
Amy," We must summon Zagtar, defender of space!"
Bender," Uh, what can I say? Must be my lucky shades! Nothing, nothing, crap, crap, garbage. Read 'em and leak salt water!"
Farnsworth," Now, Fry, before you go into space you'll need to see our staff doctor. I should warn you though, he's a little ... unusual. He wears sandals!"
Fry," Well, abducted is such an ugly word."
Fry, Except in Kansas.
Fry, That's a plus.
Fry,Oh no? I've got one single nail and another nail to nail it in with. And I'm gonna stop this infernal ice cream machine once and for all!
Fry," I'm sorry, but it is."
Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm Mexican and I find that offensive."
Fry, Ew!
Zoidberg, Oy!
Leela," I can't believe you're laughing at the tragic exploitation of a proud, bead-loving people."
Farnsworth," Leela, who are you talking to?"
Leela, That's the only ingredient of Slurm.
Fry, Are you my mommy?
Fry," Hey, don't blame me. You tried to force Guenter to be a human but he's an animal. He belongs in the wild. Or in the circus on one of those tiny tricycles. Now that's entertainment!"
Leela," Wow! The burial chamber of the 20th century's greatest spiritual leader, Al Sharpton."
Leela, Kinda cool.
Bender," Wow, I can't believe you guys did all this for me! This is the best Robanukah ever!"
Zoidberg, Robot?
Leela," Fry, are you alright?"
Leela," We're getting nowhere slowly. Here, I'll address this to the Central Filing room. Then we'll track it using my wrist LoJack-a-mater."
Farnsworth," It's stuck in there with glue or something, I don't know."
Fry, Swish!
Bender, What? Lord have mercy!
Fry," Did you find something, Hermes?"
Leela," You stifle, Bender."
Bender," Yep, we're there. Prepare to surface!"
Zoidberg, I can so relate to that.
Farnsworth, The devil take this predictable colon!
Bender, Woo! I'll just cut that.
Leela, What happened to you?
Fry, That's the 20th century spirit!
Fry," So? I'm just as important as him. It's just that, the kind of importance I have ... it doesn't matter if I don't do it."
Fry, Did you hear that? She likes me!
Bender," Hmmm, sounds like a breeding ground for humans. I'd better check it out."
Leela, But the bee stung you. It barely touched me.
Bender," Fry, we've got to discuss your living arrangements."
Bender," Oh, I'm doomed. Everybody leave me alone. I don't wanna be seen this way."
Fry, He's dead! Sorry!
Leela," You wish, you slimy worm! Hi-yah!"
Leela, No!
Bender," With all due respect, Your Majesty, I'm a robot like you. I just switch bodies with some bimbo. Go ahead, ask me something only a robot would know."
Farnsworth, Just one other item.
Leela, Alright!
Bender," Yeah, you do. You know that floor safe where you keep 10 grand? There's 5 grand in there. Don't make me wait!"
Leela, It was only half a ball.
Fry," Here's your package, sir."
Fry, You put the time code on my ass?
Zoidberg, On margin! Zoidy wanna buy on margin!
Leela," Warden Vogel, I have a new story for the children. I'm sure they'll like it more than my last one."
Amy, Look out! You're overheating!
Farnsworth, 80%!
Fry," Yeah, I like it."
Farnsworth, The professy will help! Fire indeed hot!
Farnsworth, Focus!
Leela, They buried your brother in the World Heroes section? I'm impressed.
Farnsworth, This new universe is about ten feet lower than our old one.
Hermes," Here, Dwight. The boots only cost $299.99. You invest this penny like you wanted."
Bender," Thanks, baby. I don't know what you're doing back here in the galley, 'cause you got a first-class C."
Leela," I dunno. I guess I'm just feeling uneasy about us being so on-again, off-again."
Leela, You make it look so easy.
Leela, Okay.
Leela, Nice!
Leela, Oh. That's so handsome of you.
Bender," Well, tell your mom I said hello and it's been nice catchin' up with you. Let's get this show on the road!"
Bender, Woohoo! Alright! Yay!
Bender," Oh, phew! Oh, right, they can swim. It's all coming back to me now."
Bender," Hey, that felt great! Nah, it's not working anymore."
Fry," Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty. Oh, come on! Go down already! Ah!"
Bender," Hey, look! There's a chapter of my old robot fraternity, Epsilon Rho Rho."
Hermes," Oh, yeah!"
Farnsworth, Off you go. Pleasant trip!
Fry, I can't please Leela no matter what I do. I just want her to like me.
Hermes," End of the line, man! Come on, we can still catch a twi-night double cockfight."
Fry," Well, that's not a..."
Hermes, I am here!
Leela, Oh. Maybe I am freaking out a little.
Bender," ""Compassion""? ""Shrimptoast""? ""Antiquing""? I'm alright!"
Leela, That's so sweet.
Fry, So we set up this little charade based on an episode of Speed Buggy.
Bender, I'll say!
Farnsworth, It'll be the end of civilised society.
Bender," Take that, you scurvy Kraken! That'll teach you to despoil our human booty!"
Bender, But now it's bad for me!
Fry, They sure hate Dr. Zoidberg.
Fry," Oh, baby, I'm there!"
Amy, We were sentence to two weeks in the sewer for harboring a mutant.
Bender," Looks like the fittest did a little surviving last night, huh?"
Farnsworth, Indeed. Now stop shilly-shallying! Prep the ship and line up for your pre-flight coffee enemas!
Leela," Give him a break, Fry. If this helps Bender clean up his act then I think we should be supportive."
Fry, (VO) That's when it hit me yet a third time ...
Farnsworth, Well it's occasionally off by a few seconds. What with free will and all.
Zoidberg," The President is dead. Congratulations, Mr. President!"
Farnsworth, I warned him. I warned him a time paradox duplicate is always doomed.
Zoidberg," And I'm the other guy, courage. Not enough of it. Need some from whatshisname."
Leela," Zapp, last night was a mistake."
Farnsworth, Yes?
Zoidberg, Not a day goes by I don't ask myself the same question.
Leela, At least it keeps them from driving.
Fry," Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up dolly, we could have broken it, given up and gone home by now."
Hermes, Aren't we going to cuddle?
Bender," Well, aside from causing eye cancer, these things had a lousy low-definition picture."
Leela," You tricked me into marrying you, didn't you?"
Leela, Where's Fry?
Farnsworth," Now that I've teamed up with my friend, Dr. (spiteful tone) Wernstrom, (normal tone) I feel certain we can successfully penetrate the other universe."
Amy," We've been arguing all night, Kif. Can't we go to bed?"
Bender, Sign my ass!
Bender," Stupid, air-needing lungs. The crown jewels. Now I just have to locate the guard and seduce him in... Four seconds?"
Fry, Got it.
Hermes," I didn't forget it, I just chose not to .... Barbados Slim! What are you doin' here? IS there somethin' goin' on between you two?"
Farnsworth, Why is your number seven-eighth's?
Bender," No! I mean, yes."
Zoidberg," If only it'd worked, you could go back and not waste your time on it."
Bender," Hey, everyone! Antonio here, but you can call me ""Bender""! I got ants in my butt and I needs to strut. C'mon, baby! Come on!"
Zoidberg, No doubt about it.
Bender," Usually, but not at the moment."
Bender, The year ten thousand!
Leela, We're trapped.
Fry," Wait, I know her."
Fry, W-Wouldn't it make more sense to send the robots in first a--
Fry, He's here for revenging. That's why.
Fry," Please! I'm under constant attack by machinery. I can't sleep, I can't think. I can't even think!"
Amy, Yes.
Leela, Wow. That'll be the nicest place I've ever been stood up.
Farnsworth, These are the dark matter engines I invented. They allow my starship to travel between galaxies in mere hours.
Farnsworth," I've got to stop this reverse-aging before we all shrivel up and suffer the agony of un-birth. Think, you disco duck, think!"
Bender," For one thing, we both have a tough outer shell. But lead a rich, inner life. And also ... well, you know."
Bender," I got it covered. In the event of an emergency, my ass can be used as a floatation device."
Hermes, Fry! Amy! Put your pants back on! I need a stapler.
Amy, What tapes?
Fry," Well, so what if I love a robot? It's not hurting anybody."
Hermes," Okay. The winners, at a net cost of only $12 per life cut tragically short, our Sith Overlords."
Hermes, Baby needs a new pair of shoes!
Zoidberg," Captain, I don't think we're on Pluto any longer. In fact, we may have left space as we know it."
Fry," Why not? You obviously love each other. What are you, cousins?"
Zoidberg," Mmm, delicious! Just like stale marshmallows! Ooh, and a cherry!"
Hermes," No, I want to live. Organising that forced-labour spa rekindled my lifelong love of bureaucracy."
Bender, I guess if you want children beaten ... ... you have to do it yourself.
Zoidberg," Uncle Zoid, you're looking young enough to be thrown back!"
Zoidberg, Yay!
Leela, You can't go to Omega 3; it's forbidden! I forbid you!
Fry," Oh, what the hell! Ow!"
Fry, Fatal.
Farnsworth," Oh, call me an old fool, but I believe the Lord is speaking through you. Brace yourselves, everyone!"
Leela," You're right. I can't let people down anymore. As God as my witness, I vow to earn the respect of girls and women everywhere. I will become the best blernsball player of all time."
Leela, Is it the secret ingredient?
Bender, Make it zero and you got a deal.
Bender," Well, things are starting to look up."
Bender," Hey, I think your son might also like those boots."
Bender," Sure, why not?"
Bender," Yo, Spargle. If you're such a great cook, how'd you end up in this dump?"
Leela," For your information, it's because he's hideous."
Fry," Boy, this A.C. is incredible! I'd better turn on the heater too. Boy, this heater is incredible! I'd better turn up the A.C. some more."
Leela, That's discriminatory!
Leela," Zoidberg, I'm very surprised at you, slightly."
Leela," Oh, for God's sake!"
Fry, Ew!
Leela, Is this some sort of brain scanner?
Fry, Whoa!
Bender," I'm back, baby!"
Amy," Looks like we'll be spending a lot more time together, Fry!"
Bender," Of course, it would all require split-second robotic timing. That's were I come in. You see, I own a watch."
Fry," Bender, why did you do it? We were all so happy."
Leela, Wait a minute. Why aren't you gonna kill us anymore?
Fry, What are you doing?
Zoidberg, Aawww...
Fry," Hey! I can breath and talk, just like a fish!"
Bender, There's a window in the closet.
Amy, Hey!
Hermes, Jah damnit! We're stuck.
Farnsworth," Well, it looks like I'll be needing my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely-reduced pay, of course."
Farnsworth," Bender, thank God I found you in time. I need someone in the lab immediately to fold my new sweaters."
Leela, Fry got his head stuck in a crater.
Hermes," Oh, no! It's within munching distance of the Doritos float."
Amy," Ooh, I'll have him."
Fry," Good afternoon, individuals. Sir, would you mind stepping outta the building?"
Bender, So wait. You play a high-school student who's also secretly a rock star who's also secretly a massage chair?
Leela, Wouldn't it work better if the wheels were round?
Bender," Hey, look what I won from a tourist's pocket!"
Fry, And then what happened?
Bender," Nah, but thanks to this knucklehead, I did find a new outlook on life. It's precious and sacred, and you only get so many millions of years on this Earth. So let's get brick-faced!"
Bender," Ah, can't beat fresh-squeezed!"
Amy, Yes! Right in the ike!
Fry," Of all the parasites I've had over the years, these worms are among the-- Hell! They are the best! Leela, how can I ever repay you for saving them?"
Bender, Ow! Ow! Ow!
Leela, Nowhere special. The moon.
Fry, What?
Fry," Ruh— Really? Um, I don't suppose there's any chance I can get a promotion..."
Farnsworth," And not just fired, but beaten up, too. And pretty badly."
Farnsworth," Quickly, into the sewer hole."
Zoidberg, Such a stone. Is it real? Horray!
Farnsworth," Ah say, appears we've changed 'istory too much, disahster of nightmarish proportions an' wotnot. Quite."
Bender," Look, we have to accept the fact that we all have a serious problem."
Farnsworth," I've had it with your tardiness, Fry. I expect you to arrive the same time as everyone else."
Leela, Whatever.
Amy, I'm inside the dummy to rescue you.
Hermes, What the hell are you talking about?
Bender," Scarab, four arm, bird, bird, bird!"
Fry, Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.
Bender," Ok, Fry. Come ta poppa. ... Man I'm bored. Ohhh!"
Bender, I dunno. I'll try to move my feet.
Bender," Three, two, one. Hello, big boy."
Bender, Uh... Yes!
Farnsworth, Oh uh.
Leela, What?
Fry, I feel better now. Why is so many different parades smooshed together?
Bender," How does a nobody like me get famous? I know! Hey, look! I'm stuck! But I haven't given up hope! Call a soft-news journalist!"
Fry, Leela! You're awake!
Bender, Shut up.
Bender, What's this junk?
Bender," Go, man! Go!"
Bender, Is there an app for kissin' my shiny metal ass?
Bender, I'll pet him. I'll pet him with both hands! Ow! My ass! Get off!
Zoidberg, I'm swelling with patriotic mucus!
Fry," Look, Leela. I know there's some perfect, amazing thing I can do to make you love me, and when I figure out what it is--"
Bender," Yeah. By the way, if she calls, I'm not here. All I know is this gold says that was the best mission ever!"
Leela," Uh, me too."
Hermes," Yes, dear."
Leela, Zero.
Bender, Same reason you hocked your teeth.
Leela, Really?
Bender, Hey!
Bender, I bent him.
Leela, I thought circusitis only affected children.
Bender," Cram it, lobster! That is a good idea. I'll go call her."
Fry," From that old church to the north. They had two burning, so I figured they wouldn't miss one."
Bender, Moron!
Fry, And you smell like one too!
Zoidberg, Go!
Bender, Yeah. Emotions are dumb and should be hated.
Farnsworth, There it is! The edge of the universe!
Farnsworth," Oh, my."
Bender," Calculon, as your hot water heater ... ... I would be remiss if I didn't bring you scripts that could make you an international film star."
Zoidberg, Give me that. More weight!
Amy, So the orgy's off?
Bender, Thank you for your patronage. We know you have a choice in airlines and you made the wrong one. No refunds!
Fry, But you're not really a lady anyway. Right?
Leela, Of course I'm alive.
Fry, Kif touched everybody there. Couldn't any one of us be the mother?
Farnsworth," Yes, they have! It's called Australopithecus africanus!"
Zoidberg, That stench. That heavenly stench! More!
Fry, Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited by boxes.
Zoidberg, Do you validate parking?
Leela, Maybe I was too harsh on Fry. He didn't ruin my life on purpose.
Fry, But in this case I-I just don't think it'll do any good.
Amy, It's gorgeous. That place used to be a big dump.
Fry, Sort of.
Fry, I refuse to testify on the grounds that my organs will be chopped up into a patty.
Fry," Ooh! Ho, ho, ho!"
Farnsworth, Thank God there are plenty of escape pods. We won't have to dress up like women and children.
Bender, So? It's not like it's the only one we've got.
Fry," So that's my story, Father Changstein el Gamahl. Is there anything religion can do to help me find my friend?"
Fry, No!
Leela," Oh, you're right. Tomorrow is the day we fight back."
Fry," Professor, please. The fate of the world depends on you getting to second base with Mom."
Leela," This place is 3,000 years old. What could possibly be left to discover?"
Bender, That'll teach those other horses to take drugs!
Leela, How can you trick people into drinking something that comes out of your behind? It's disgusting.
Leela, You mean a frown?
Fry," I'll tell them you went out prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger."
Fry, Executive?!
Fry," That's the saltiest thing I've ever tasted. And I've once ate a big, heaping bowl of salt!"
Bender," Uh, no, actually I'm an Epsilon from way back."
Bender," There's no time now. Quick, Zoidberg! Take three steps to your right!"
Zoidberg, I can't believe everybody's just ad-libbing!
Leela," It wasn't unavoidable! You just had to stop cutting my spine when I yelled, ""Stop! You're cutting my spine!"""
Farnsworth, I never married.
Bender, ¡Sí! Ouch-o!
Bender," A little of this, huh?"
Zoidberg, Edna?
Leela," I'm fine, thank you. A real pilot can navigate by feel alone."
Leela," Oh. Thank you. You know what, Fry? I don't care if you're not the most important person in the universe. It really makes me happy to see you right now."
Fry, Kill-check two is go!
Hermes, Sounds like a muskrat's caught in there.
Leela," OK. As an alien who was abandoned on Earth, I've never really belonged anywhere."
Bender," What you talkin' 'bout, Professor?!"
Leela, There. No rampaging for you tonight.
Amy," Hey, look at Nibbler!"
Fry, Just like very other girl I've dated.
Hermes, Kiss my front butt.
Bender," No, it's Fry who's crazy in this one."
Fry, Whatever.
Amy, We have to cut the rope!
Leela," Professor, no!"
Leela," Hmm. If we can re-route engine power through the primary weapons and reconfigure them to Melllvar's frequency, that should overload his electro-quantum structure."
Amy, Aw!
Fry, What just happened? Why is the ball on that springy thing?
Farnsworth," Oh, Lord! Hiking is always such a strain on the buttocks."
Bender," Um, that was a practice miracle. Who's next?"
Leela," OK, look. If I help you with this do you promise to get out of my gender and stay out?"
Bender, It's already 10 o'clock!
Farnsworth," Don't you think I already tried that? No. I'm afraid, the crystal is lost forever."
Bender," Help, help. (Echoing ) Help!"
Bender, You're twice the the he ever was.
Fry," Yeah, that'd be a timesaver."
Amy," Hey, this isn't so bad."
Amy, Uh-uh.
Bender," Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all the pillows at once."
Bender," My birthplace. It's closed! There's not even a shrine to me. With a gift shop, selling piñatas of me!"
Farnsworth, Indeed. It's pure diamondium!
Zoidberg," Strange  Why would Nixon, an awkward, uncomfortable man, suddenly throw a party, one of the most social events imaginable? It's a trap, is why! They're going to deactivate all the robots! I don't hear any gasping."
Farnsworth," Uh, yes, here I am, OK, now, hello there. Now, we all know telescopes allow us to see distant objects. But what if we want to smell distant objects? Well now we can! Thanks to my new invention ... the Smellescope."
Fry, What am I gonna do?
Farnsworth," Ah, Hermes! Crew, meet Hermes Conrad. He manages my delivery business, pays the bills, notifies next of kin, what have you."
Hermes," Comet ahoy! Why, it's lit up like a smooth, refreshing Chesterfield."
Leela, Clobberella!
Fry," What? I'm old. Listen  Hey, you kids, get off the lawn!"
Leela," Fry, this isn't healthy. You're living in the past."
Zoidberg, Let's just hope Calculon breaks our legs; they'll grow back.
Bender," Oh, sweet mercy.  My hellish nightmare is over. I never have to party again."
Leela, Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't break and load all the dark matter into the left engine.
Fry, And this is Dr. Zoidberg.
Farnsworth," Aha! That satellite was scuttled on Enceladus, Saturn's main dump moon!"
Fry, 'Cause he was a loner who hated the popular monsters yet longed to be one.
Leela," We are not packing lunches, you walking beer commercials. It was you men who drove this company into the ground. Remember Fry's idea to offer free delivery?"
Fry, Let's just get inside the shack.
Fry, Man in the attic!
Leela, I never loved you.
Hermes," Listen up, people."
Leela, Ugh! Great. We're two days from Earth with no food.
Hermes," Tomorrow morning. After the ""festivities""."
Fry, Ooh!
Fry, Uh...
Farnsworth, Everyone to The Situation Room!
Fry, Shut up and take my money!!
Fry, For Slurms!
Fry, Too bad you can't spend it.
Hermes, Uh-oh. I think we're walking in circles. I recognise the pattern of striations on that gypsum formation.
Fry, Now let us each remember the best things about Bender in our own way. Professor?
Bender, Zero! And what a surprise! Look who's scraping up the filth! Is it a human child? I wish!
Farnsworth," Yes, yes."
Farnsworth," A mass extinction. That solar flare created a huge electromagnetic pulse that while harmless to organic life, short-circuited the robo-dinosaurs."
Bender,"  Well, let's at least throw this TV out. The batteries in the remote are gettin' low."
Leela," I lance her every few months, but she always grows back. It's hard enough being a cyclops, but if anyone found out about Susan, I'd be devastated."
Farnsworth, I don't know why I even build these things.
Bender," Yeah. Life, schmife."
Bender, I'm no Bender. You got me mixed up with another Robot.
Fry, Download a celebrity from the Internet? What part of that do I understand?
Hermes, Then what is our only hope?!
Fry, What's over that hill?
Fry, What are the cigars for?
Bender," People, I'm sorry. You've never before heard me say those words, or even the individual letters that make them up. But I am. And with a huge amount of modesty, I humbly beg your forgiveness."
Bender," Now to go switch bodies with Zoidberg, sneak past the metal detector and clip the alarm wires, all in less than... Ten minutes ago! Oh! Uh, could you come back when my chump gets here?"
Leela, That doesn't seem fair.
Leela, That's crazy! It's been lost for centuries!
Farnsworth, I've got to find a way to escape the horrible ravages of youth. Suddenly I'm going to the bathroom like clockwork every three hours. And those jerks at social security stopped sending me checks. Now I have to pay them!
Fry, What's happening? Are you urinating?
Farnsworth, Yay!
Leela," It's OK, Fry. You know we'll always be friends, right?"
Leela, No. There's already a soda like that  Soylent Cola.
Fry, Pst. I need the apartment tonight. Go see a saucy puppet show.
Leela," Alright, this is for their own good. Don't leave orphans. Gotta kill entire families. But they're so cute. No! You can do this. It's just like murdering a little butler. I-I can't look. Oh, no! What have I done? Oh, you poor little guy! I'm so sorry I-- Bender? Bend. 2] Cheese It! He stands up and takes the bullet out of his head. Leela stops crying.] What's going on? Were you hiding out with these little guys?"
Leela, Nothing.
Bender," Yeah I know, that's why I asked if what I did-- Forget it."
Bender," Guys, guys! Hedonism bot is finally settling down and marrying a nice house in the suburb. But tonight, he's having the girls gone wildest bachelor party of all time."
Leela, My parents! They're coming up from the sewers for a visit Sunday.
Farnsworth, It's nonconvergent!
Farnsworth," Wha?! Ah, yes. The Farnsworths boast a proud and distinguished lineage. No wormy fruit on this tree."
Fry, Phew! That's a load off my mind.
Hermes, I got you an official Bender hat.
Fry," I've never been able to put into words how I feel about you. But somewhere among these trillions of hearts, those words must already exist. And I'm gonna find them."
Fry," One hour from now, I travel back in time for free pizza."
Bender," Fry, how can you be so naive? He was joking. Get it?"
Zoidberg," Hurry up with the water. I'm steaming inside my own shell, I am. It's that hot, it is!"
Leela, Brain. Brain make people dumb.
Farnsworth," Oh, it's got a million and one uses."
Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. I refuse to fight. I'm a conscientious objector."
Leela, I volunteer.
Hermes, What makes you think that'll work?
Bender," These balls are making me testy. If they don't stop bouncing and jiggling, I swear I'm gonna shove this treaty up their-- Wait a second. Where do you shove things up a ball?"
Fry, I only have one.
Fry, Alright!
Amy, That's exactly the number we need.
Leela, 0101100101. What does it mean?
Fry, I'm dying of thirst. Grab my feet and dunk my head in so I can drink.
Leela, Shh.
Bender, Bullseye!
Farnsworth, You're going to do his laundry?
Bender," Hi! I'm Bender, this is my Robot Bender, and this is my other Robot Bender."
Leela," What? Oh, this is horrible. I won't be able to hear Fry's opera."
Fry," I think the leak's stopping itself. Wait. Wait. Yeah, there we go. Wait. Yeah!"
Fry," Wait a minute, Bender is my best friend. We can't just dump him in the gutter like Grandma's ashes."
Fry," OK, my best friend's life is at stake. I can finally prove that I'm not a coward. Will you push me?"
Zoidberg, Enough with the questions. More weight! More! More!
Farnsworth, It's not that bad. It's just laden with toxic minerals. But not for long.
Farnsworth, Then I have no choice but to charge you the full cost of the materials  $10.
Fry," Y'know, I guess it should be but, actually, I'm glad. I had nothing to live for in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me."
Fry, You mean these?
Fry," Hey, I remember you. I was gonna vote for you one time. But voting isn't cool so I stayed home alone and got trashed on Listerine."
Fry," Well, at least my assassin will get what's coming to him."
Leela," Zapp?  Where are you? Oh, God, I'm actually starting to miss him."
Bender, It was coming right at us.
Leela," I could kiss you, Professor."
Leela," You mean something like, ""The best defense is a good fence?"""
Fry," Sorry, I'm late."
Fry, Captain Yesterday!
Fry," I don't know, I don't know. Just say anything. As long as it's compelling, mesmerising, a tour de force."
Farnsworth, Santa's coming! Initiate defenses!
Hermes, And now you're asking for a day off? Get out of my and my sight! You're bogarting my patience.
Zoidberg," We're gonna crash, even."
Farnsworth, So long!
Fry," Don't wave your fancy degrees at me! I recognise all this stuff. Petrified sausages, old Mr. Patelli. And that's--"
Bender, Can do!
Leela, Great Cheech's ghost!
Zoidberg," Wait, there's more. Once I wire some good-faith money to an overseas bank account, I'll inherit his kingdom, his canoe, and his plump young wife."
Zoidberg," That is low, Hermes. Just because you don't have a body, you don't want anyone else to be prince of Nigeria. Well, try and stop me from wiring that money."
Zoidberg," Sorry, you must have been boring me."
Fry, One foot in the grave.
Leela," What was that? Oh, my God! We're heading straight into a black hole."
Fry," Oh, you're not so shallow that you find me repulsive because of my body, are you?"
Bender, You mean I'm not a great fighter? I just won 'cause I'm popular?
Zoidberg, I'd like to propose a toast to ... coat check number 84.
Bender," Oh, sure."
Bender, You bastard!
Leela," You know, Bender may not have learned anything from me, but I think I actually learned something from him. So long, jerkwads!"
Bender, Superheroes away!
Fry," No! I refuse to give up! Wake up, Leela! I! Love! You!"
Fry," There. That time, I left both lanterns in place."
Fry," Wait, hold on. I don't like the sound of that. Let's just go alphabetically."
Bender," Danny-boy? You're at my funeral, singing about some dead stiff named Danny-boy? You really are a massive bonehead."
Fry, Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam!
Leela," Uh, here."
Bender, I'm back from lots of stuff.
Fry," Madam, I am in command now."
Bender, Maybe there's another way.
Leela, We sure are cheerful this morning.
Bender, Wait here and earn interest while I find my robot body.
Zoidberg," I don't know, but it's infectious!"
Leela, What are you going to do? Sleep in a big pile like hamsters?
Leela, The pollution from the factory! It caused a greenhouse effect.
Farnsworth, My new bent outlook has completely re-energised me. I'm even dating a young Brazilian retired actress.
Zoidberg, Thank you. These'll come in handy for my new hair. Finally I look as pretty as I feel!
Bender," Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this! If I'm not gonna catch a fish, I might as well not catch a big fish. There. Like most of life's problems this one can be solved with bending."
Farnsworth," Goodness, there must be 50 papers in that bundle! That's a big number, 50."
Bender," Well, well, well. You didn't make up that TV show! You just wrote down what these space twerps said!"
Fry," Dear Horse God, I know I don't usually pray to you. Sometimes I doubt you even exist. But if you're willing to grant me luck, please, stamp your hoof once. Come on, number six! Move it! Don't do that! What are you-- Man, it's contagious!"
Fry," Thus sayeth the tentacle, ""Verily, thou shalt rejoice in the house of the tentacle."""
Leela, Sort of like a giant karaoke machine?
Fry, Caught you! I saw you looking at the atom!
Amy," Uh, he seems really nice but, well, I already have a boyfriend."
Leela, Yes! I will!
Fry," Well, I may not have brain smarts, but at least I have street smarts."
Leela, I don't have any god da- mother f- anger issues.
Farnsworth," Oh, it was a brilliant scheme. But you made one fatal mistake ... leaving this confession note."
Leela, What?
Zoidberg, Friend?!
Bender, Hey!
Amy," One diet double Martini, please."
Leela," Professor, please! Society's never gonna make any progress until we all learn to pretend to like each other. Now let's go over there and make these hideous strangers feel welcome."
Farnsworth, Dear Lord! A coaster! The Femmzoil must be sachet-ing girlishly into your processor.
Leela, Company! Attack!
Fry, Check.
Fry," Relax, mammal. My robotic software shall meet your calculatory needs. What is the meaning of this symbol?"
Fry," Then today's your lucky day, because I happen to be a holding, stroking, lovin' machine! Also spankin'."
Fry, I think it was just an airport. They had a place where you could buy nuts.
Leela, Come on! We gotta save Bender.
Bender," Precocious little scamp, ain't I?"
Bender," That new robot is great, huh? Sure made me look like a pile of crap!"
Amy," Bender, why do you have to be so mean to me?"
Fry, This is weak!
Amy," Oh, yeah, smarty paws? You may have built the ratchet but you can't reach the core without 4,000 miles of superconducting wire. The ball of yarn!"
Bender, You're all losers. My name's Bender.
Leela, I 'unno!
Fry, He's dead.
Zoidberg, How about I just lay down?
Bender, Party!
Fry, Bender's sick. Need any help taking off?
Farnsworth, But...
Leela, Bomb? What bomb?
Bender, Them again?
Fry, Hey! You look me in the shins and say that.
Fry, So you're telling me they broadcast commercials into people's dreams?
Bender," I'm tired of your yapping. All you ever do is complain, you never try to make things better. Well, I'm running away from this dead-end family! I know there's a place for people like me with new ideas. There has to be!"
Zoidberg, Wood!
Zoidberg," Nothing! I'm leaving. But if you have extra courage I'd haul it away for you, maybe?"
Fry, Everybody's ice-fishing! How come nobody's ice-fishing?
Fry," Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza."
Leela," Amy, you don't go up from the sticker price."
Bender, What's the worst that can happen?
Bender," As your agent, I have access to you at all times."
Fry, You're only four years old?
Leela," Aw, is shnookums not feeling schtimuwated?"
Zoidberg," Hey, look! A fog is rolling in."
Zoidberg, We crustaceans don't like steam. I'm going to go work out with the Nautilus!
Zoidberg, Would one of you chicks change the thermostat?
Leela, That's so plausible I can't believe it!
Bender," Please, call me Bender."
Bender," Uh, no! Never!"
Fry, Bigfoot! He's real! I knew it! The Loch Ness Monster's book was right!
Leela," Love your optimism, Fry. But seriously, you've got to tell Bender you're moving out."
Fry," Aw, come on! You guys have forever to look for God. All I'm asking is one measly lifetime to find my friend."
Fry," Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!"
Fry, Help!  Police!
Zoidberg, Oh.
Bender," Hmm, my tux doesn't fit. Probably because I've grown so much since I last wore it, or evolved, one might say."
Fry," Leela! Oh, my God! You saved my life. I am gonna get you so many lizards!"
Farnsworth, There's only one thing we can do--
Leela, It's so close! Is there any chance of cross-contamination?
Leela, So my question is this  What if I found my true home? Ow!
Bender," Me too. Man, we have a lot in common, huh?"
Hermes," Which concludes the summary of the movie I saw last night. Now, any old business?"
Fry, What a weird dream! I'll never get back to sleep.
Bender," Whatever you say, chief. I'll show you what I got in stock."
Bender," Nah, I'm comfy out here under the stars. Real comfy!"
Fry," Oh, you sad, worthless human."
Leela, Just get to work.
Leela, But why did you have all five weddings on the same day?
Fry," Man, this costume is so damn heavy!"
Farnsworth," Party, Bender!  Party for your life!"
Bender, I'm in! I'm in! So when were you planning the breakout?
Bender," Popplers can't talk. Leela must be hallucinating from not eating enough Popplers. Here, eat some now."
Leela," If the Smellescope can pick up the Professor's odour, we may have a chance to save him."
Fry, It's like that time I peeked in the kitchen at Imperial Hunan.
Fry," But the Dark One could look like anything or anyone, right?"
Leela," Survivor, Pat Benatar, The Scorpions. The list goes on."
Bender, Leave me alone!
Bender, Whattya got? Disposal trouble?
Hermes," As long as we eat 'er filthy scrambled eggs, you'll never find out."
Fry, We're heroes!
Fry, I don't know. Let's ask this guy.
Bender," Falcon, this is Blue Raven, the goose has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested. Hey, guess what you're accessories to?"
Zoidberg," Hmm, this ""love"" intrigues me. Teach me to fake it."
Fry, Anchovies? You know? Those little headless fish?
Leela, It's too beautiful to open. Can I open it?
Bender, Death to humans!
Hermes, Is this really happening or just being staged?
Fry," As vice chairman of Planet Express, I'd like to say a few words. There comes a time for every man who becomes rich and deserts his friends, when he goes back how it was. For me, that time is now."
Fry, There must be some way I can stop this wedding. What if I steal the wedding ring?
Fry," I'm from the 20th century. Go ahead, ask me anything."
Bender, I can't ask for his help because--
Leela, Wipe out all thought? My God! They're like flying televisions.
Leela," Now, let's fight."
Bender," ""Bender""!"
Farnsworth," Err, what?  Oh, my, yes.  You've got the go-ahead, Mr. Wong.  This place is deader than last year's cat."
Leela," Shame on all of you. After everything we've been through together, do you really think Fry would-"
Bender, Why not?
Bender, I thought that was number two.
Leela," Not at all. Amy, stop it! Fry, help! She's turning me into a parade float!"
Farnsworth," Ahh, paradox resolved. Someone get a mop."
Leela, Quick! Let's duck in here!
Fry, That's so interesting. Maybe we could get to know each other over a coffee.
Leela, Big Z?
Leela," Oh, Chaz!"
Fry, Say what?
Amy, Woohoo!
Farnsworth, It means we're back on the air!
Bender, But we just had jobs!
Bender," You're no Femputer, you're a Fembot!"
Bender, Where'd it go?
Bender," Hey, ladies, I found some... What the—? There was only enough petroleum for four and a half weeks of oil wrestling. But it lasted 500 million years! It's a miracle!"
Leela," Sorry, but we need to practise hand-to-hand combat in case an enemy knocks the laser guns out of our hands and they slide way across the room."
Fry," Well, that covers the first three killings."
Farnsworth, Indeed so.
Bender, What should we point it at first?
Hermes," So your delivery company is just a cute, harmless paper route?"
Farnsworth, What?
Fry," Wow! It's too bad you can't see, Leela, 'cause there's a cool ship out there shooting at somebody."
Bender, What about me?
Hermes," You may be gelatinous, but not even the Mochi Phanton could perform such intricate motions!"
Fry, See you in class!
Bender, Yep!
Leela, We made it!
Bender," So, if I die..."
Farnsworth," No. According to this gizmometer, Fry is dead and nothing can bring him back. Remarkable!"
Leela," Bender, stop! It's a baby!"
Bender, I'll get a couple of chumps to help me.
Farnsworth," No, just the two."
Fry," Man, it's a total sty! For the first time in a thousand years, I feel like I'm home."
Fry," Ah, futuristic!"
Fry, W-W-Wait. You mean ... you ... and Mom--
Fry," I learned how to work the gravity pump too. In case we need to move more stars. So, are we dating now?"
Bender, Faster! Faster!
Leela," Now, I'll use the magnet to get the keys back in there."
Fry, Like that Bible guy who got swallowed by the whale! Pinocchio!
Bender," Yup. And there's still a little more tension, so look out. You so ugly, when trick-or-treaters come to your house, they give you candy."
Fry, What I've become.
Bender, Is this the robot company? Cause I have a complaint about a defective robot. His name is me!
Zoidberg," And that's how I got my new shell. It looks just like the shell I threw out yesterday and I found it in the same dumpster, but this one had a live raccoon inside. Pretty good story, eh, Hermes?"
Leela, Holy cr—
Bender," Oh, boy!"
Bender, They make me look cool.
Fry, I'm sorry. I should've asked what was bothering you. I've been kind of preoccupied.
Fry, Hello 2000. I'm home.
Fry, It's kinda cramped in here. I don't even have room to hang my clothes.
Bender, I'm really starting to swell up with beer. I must look ridiculous.
Leela, Come on! It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so we'd spend Valentine's Day together.
Bender, Uh-oh.
Fry, Maybe he's back at the motel.
Farnsworth," In your face, decumbent urinators."
Bender, My ass! My beautiful ass!
Amy, Look! My hair got singed into an even cuter do!
Bender, I meant yourself to death.
Farnsworth, I don't know you naked crook.
Leela, He must have jumped ship with the atom the second we landed.
Bender, What? This is the worst kind of discrimination. The kind against me!
Leela, A talk? You can't break up with me. You're my pet!
Leela," But, Bender, you are--"
Bender," Poor guy. Maybe you'd feel better if I had a drink. Crummy keg! It's completely ta-- Oh, you're a robot!"
Leela, We just told you!
Fry," So long, Earth. Thanks for the air and whatnot."
Leela, Wait a second. All Benders are powered by alcohol!
Bender, Here we go. Here we go!
Leela," Alright, we don't have much time to collect these animals. The planet is supposed to collapse in approximately two hours ago."
Fry," Yes. But it's only recently that I've been able to articulate my thoughts. I love you, Leela, and I always have."
Leela, He is so not. He's just being polite.
Leela, This is so much fun Lars. Most men are intimidated by the fact that I could kill them with the flick of my wrist.
Leela," Hey, what's rattling around in there?"
Amy, Don't be a sucker. You won't come out anywhere near the hole. You need to aim for the jaws just when they start to close.
Fry," Y'know, I saw the first 30 seconds of that episode. If I could make up an ending, maybe we could act it out ourselves."
Farnsworth," As my successor, I'm trusting you to carry on my work. These are just some of the half-finished inventions you'll spend your life finishing."
Amy," But, I was really having fun. If that's how you feel."
Bender," Please stop crying, Fry. Here. I assumed you were just pretending to love the dog to toy with my emotions. Oh, what have I done?"
Fry, The Grumpy Snail. Sorry!
Bender, You are. What about that little girl you visited in the hospital? You know the one I mean? The one who died?
Bender," Harpoon, my ass!"
Leela, They've blown out one of our engines!
Farnsworth," This will not stand! I'll take you on, you air-balling bozos."
Fry," Hey, what did you do to him?"
Fry," I dunno, Randy. I just feel like my life's falling apart. The Professor's in jail and now Leela's gone forever."
Bender, I challenge you to a duel on the field of honor.
Farnsworth," Once two bodies have switched minds, they can never switch back. However, perhaps they can. Maybe we can swap back using a third body for temporary storage space."
Fry, Um... Is it dry up here?
Fry," But that's not why people watch TV. Clever things make people feel stupid, and unexpected things make them feel scared."
Hermes, That just raises further questions!
Fry," Ah, just like my dad used to make ... until McDonald's fired him."
Leela," Lars, no!"
Fry, Yeah.
Leela, I don't think anyone's here to make that claim.
Leela, Oh come on Bender. Last month it was Robomadan and before that Robonzaa.
Fry," You just wanna talk, it has nothing to do with mating."
Farnsworth," Ooh, good, Leela. You're here. I'd like to describe my foot pain. My left has a sharp jabbing throb near the bunion, while the other's got a searing pain like gout. Maybe it's too much albumin because of gravity..."
Leela, Our car broke down and we're out of oxygen. Can we borrow some?
Farnsworth, There's no time to lose. I'm off to my lab to build a successor-naming machine!
Amy, Just relax. I'm sure my parents will love you.
Amy," Come on in, Leela! Take that ugly coat off!"
Zoidberg, This is very difficult. But I'll try... Friend.
Leela," No, you ""Shut up! We gotta get outta here!"""
Leela," Thank you, Angus."
Amy," Oh, yeah! Pachinko break!"
Zoidberg, What?
Bender, Woo-hoo! I'm popular!
Leela," But Fry's our friend, Bender."
Fry, Those three exterminators are hilarious.
Bender, Is this him?
Leela," Fry, I have to talk to you. You're in terrible danger."
Zoidberg, I love this part.
Fry, Is that a problem?
Bender, Alright!
Zoidberg, Ma! Pa! Our precious ranch!
Leela, Nothing. We just talked.
Fry, Flexo!
Leela," That's such a beautiful thought, Fry. And what's more amazing, you expressed it without spewing crumbs at me."
Bender," Yeah, we're back."
Fry, Boring!
Leela, But the ship is dirty.
Fry," Yeah, I get that a lot."
Farnsworth," Bender, you blew out your excess capacity!  You're cured!"
Bender, I'll aways treasure it and immediately hock it.
Leela, That's more like it.
Leela, Well I think you dating a Manbot is a disgrace and I refuse to be involved. And you have way too much lipstick on.
Amy," It was the weirdest thing. We went to sleep, and when we woke up, our cave husbands were gone."
Fry, Wow! I have been gone a long time.
Fry, But there's probably some cool forbidden stuff you can steal.
Farnsworth," Exactly! That's a discontinuous electromagnetic field. Wernstrom tried to warn me, but I was too damn stubborn! Hermes, get Wernstrom on the line so I can apologize."
Bender," Oh, please, let it be me."
Farnsworth," Uh, that one kills everything everywhere."
Leela," You know, Zapp, someone ought to teach you a lesson."
Zoidberg," Don't forget the spasms, coma, and death."
Fry, Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see it I'll think back to that moment when we almost-- Never mind!
Fry, I just wish I could've showed you guys how great they were. I may be rich but I still can't buy back all the things I miss from the 20th century.
Fry, Correction  We're unemployed but we have a doddering old relative to mooch off of.
Bender, I was just about to suggest the same thing. Pay dirt!
Bender," Take a barf buddy. Ok suicide booth, give me your best shot. Electrocution please, side order of poison. Helloooo? Kill me you stupid machine. ... What the ... local calls fifty cents? It's a street corner telephone parlor! Oh what kind of horrible suicide free time is this? Wait a minute, maybe this handy encyclopedia of humans will help me track Fry down."
Fry, Come on! Come on!
Fry, What's so wonderful about Leela being normal? The rest of us aren't normal and that's what makes us great. Like Dr. Zoidberg  He's a weird monster who smells like he eats garbage and does.
Farnsworth," Don't worry. The fat pig will do fine thanks to this flabbo-dynamic spandex bodysuit I've designed. It redistributes his weight, shifting his centre of gravity closer to his knees."
Bender," Go, Masked Unit! Uh, hey, buddy! Yo! You mind taking your head off?"
Amy, But you just said--
Bender, I'd be cuddly too if someone gave me a new cape.
Fry, Is he objecting or backing up?
Amy, I know how to make love!
Bender," Wake up, buddy. End of the line!"
Farnsworth, Whaaa?
Bender," Are you kidding? I've always wanted to break into gooning! Hey, Elzar! I quit!"
Amy," No, Kif! It's too risky. You don't have to do this to prove your manliness."
Amy, It's working! Just a little faster!
Hermes," Planet Express stockholders, I present our chief executive officer, Professor Hubert Farnsworth."
Farnsworth, Indeed. Wot's become of the dear old USA?
Fry," So, I guess, without jobs, we'll be fugitives forever."
Farnsworth," In fact, you were fired two years ago! That's when we were shut down by the delivery network."
Fry, Wait a second! I know that monkey. His name is Donkey.
Fry, I don't know. I got nervous and I started thinking about neck bolts. Wow! Did you see that vase break? It was all like--
Zoidberg, Why with all the crying? So that's where I left my shell.
Fry, Uh...
Bender, What if I do something different?
Amy, What's wrong?
Leela," Oh, my God! It's Mom! I've never seen her in person before."
Fry, We're gonna die! (calmly) Right?
Bender," Damn it, I'm supposed to be perfect. Inspector 5 gave me his blessing! How could he bring me into this world knowing I gonna die?"
Farnsworth, You die. Or as you put it
Fry, What smells like bloody sinuses?
Bender," Well, I'm sick of her."
Bender, There was nothing wrong with that food. The salt level was 10% less than a lethal dose.
Fry, I'm never going to get used to the 31st century. Caffinated bacon? Baconated grapefruit? Admiral Crunch?
Amy, Oh. That'll be fun.
Bender, Happy. I like this feeling. Just don't revert to your usual mopey self.
Fry, I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just didn't have the grades. Nor the physical endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.
Leela," Fry, I've now seen two comic books, so listen to me. Why should I care about the hero when all he does is cry?"
Fry, I'm not havin' any problem.
Fry, Ooh! eBay!
Fry, Hi--
Bender," Wot's with th' fruity accent, ducky? Bollocks! Ah've got it, too!"
Leela, Until she sneaks out!
Fry, Nooo!
Zoidberg, I'm not hearing a no.
Bender," Sir, you forget yourself! Shut up!"
Fry," Yeah, I get that a lot."
Leela," Come on, say ""mama""."
Zoidberg," So what's in the box, already?"
Leela, I like you.
Amy, Why?
Bender, Nothing. Today's active humans prefer a low calorie bait.
Fry, I ordered a pizza.
Farnsworth, I move that your cat stinks and is ugly.
Fry, That's birth for you.
Leela, Only the Professor knows how to fix it. We have to wake him up.
Fry," Hey, Mr. Panucci, I'm back from that delivery to the cryogenic lab."
Leela," I'm sure I've got a great kids' story in me. I just need to think of three of some kind of animal. Concentrate, Leela! Concentrate! Fry, I'm writing here! Do you have to play that?"
Fry, You an' I are enemies now!
Fry," Oh, it's hopeless. I did something so great that it won Leela's heart and I'll never, ever know what it was. My life is empty."
Leela," No way, Jack. You disobeyed an order, so now you have to deliver all 40 pillows by hand."
Fry," Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head."
Zoidberg," Ah! Thank you, golf slave. Bah! Rich people wouldn't waste their time on this nonsense. Plus, these eggs are gritty and tasteless."
Leela, Is... is he okay?
Leela, Can do!
Farnsworth," Shut up, friends. My Internet browser heard us saying the word ""Fry"" and it found a movie about Philip J. Fry for us. It also opened my calendar to Friday and ordered me some French fries."
Bender, Yeah!
Fry," I know it may seem strange that I have feelings for an octopus monster from another universe. And yes, perhaps it's not the storybook romance that's been crammed down our throats by (quoting the syllables) ""Hollywood."" But the Monsterpus has loved us from afar since we were amoebas. Only when the space anomaly opened could it finally express a billion years of longing."
Fry," Uh, Leela, I think there might be something wrong with the coffee machine."
Bender," I'll avenge you, master. I swear, in the presence of these drunken bums, that I shall defeat Elzar!"
Bender, What? Did you just say--
Fry, I once had a best friend who liked to smell things with me.
Fry, Fry-lo.
Fry," Looks like we're under Park Avenue. Ooh, ritzy! Just think  All this was probably once a charity luncheon for the Met."
Leela, What? No. No! Of course not!
Fry," They're supposed to be some kinda, you know, pine tree."
Bender," I got the most followers cuz I give the people what they want, like this video of you doin' karate in your underpants."
Fry, Ow! That ... didn't hurt.
Zoidberg, There.
Bender, Huh? It's bendering time! Take this. And this!
Leela, How could you do this?!!
Bender," There must be somethin' to steal on this island.  Hey, it's Leela!"
Amy, Huh? You don't like chocolate?
Leela," Now that we got their attention, it's time to hit them where they sit, by bending the West Side Pipeway to return all sewage to the surface."
Fry, No.
Leela, That's even more horrific! Is all the work done by children?
Leela," No, Leela will show you out. Me. Leela."
Bender, No! I wanna live! There's still too many things I don't own!
Zoidberg," There you go, Leela. Good as new!"
Fry," Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious how an aromatic chain of hydrocarbons can evoke our deepest emotions. For you."
Fry, Cool. Can I try these on before I buy them?
Zoidberg," I recommend the health cure on Spa 5, the sauna planet. Here, read."
Hermes," Robots don't say ""ye""!"
Leela, But that was my idea!
Hermes," I hear that! I aks him to set the table, instead he goes out to buy you a present. Selfish dog."
Farnsworth, Careful with the giblets!
Bender, That's no flying saucer! That's my ass!
Leela," I had a great time today. The flowers, the puddle, the way you hurt that guy. But can I aks you something?"
Bender," We're back, baby!"
Bender," Buddy, you may be wrapped in greasy skin, but inside, you've got the heart of a robot."
Leela, Autopilot?
Leela," Oh, Mom, Dad, I can't believe I have to spend the rest of my life in this hellhole. I'm sorry."
Zoidberg, Zoidy want balloon! Want balloon now! Zoidy want go outside!
Bender, And blood! Don't forget about Fry's blood!
Leela," Look, Al. I know you've been living alone a long time and I can sympathise, but I'm not your maid."
Fry, Really?
Fry, You... And— And the Chief?!
Leela, I don't get it.
Leela, That's kinda pathetic.
Bender," Pretty annoying, huh, Leela?"
Bender," There's a baby in there, huh?"
Fry, Wow!
Farnsworth," Oh, boo-hoo."
Zoidberg, I'm afraid Fry lost a lotta juice. He's developed Simpsons jaundice.
Bender, Union forever! Lousy scabs! They can't do those things! Et cetera!
Fry," Hey, and while we're on the base, I'll visit my grandfather, Enos. He was stationed at Roswell."
Zoidberg," And they walk up to the bar and then-- Uh-oh. Wait, stop! I've got more!"
Bender," Ah-ah-ah. Read 'em and weep, and then tell me what they are."
Bender," Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero..."
Leela, Kind of fatty.
Bender," Well I don't love them. Aw! I don't know why but when I look down at their little faces, it makes me wanna puke! In a good way!"
Leela, Because I've always wanted to. I just never realised it before I met you.
Bender, So anyway your dog is melted. Now we're friends again.
Leela," Here's to Amy, single, lonely, and fabulous."
Zoidberg," Please, sir, I love you like a father!"
Bender," Not even close. Goodbye, everybody! Don't touch my stuff after I'm dead. It's booby trapped!"
Fry, Good old Bender!
Bender, This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel.
Farnsworth, How dare you!?
Bender, Afterlife? Pft. If I thought I had to go through a whole other life I'd kill myself right now.
Bender," All two tons of me, and if you think that's shocking; wait 'til you see w..."
Fry, Lights! Camera one! Camera two! Camera three!
Fry, That's impossible because my time is worthless!
Amy, What's happening?! Did you kill it?!
Fry, What's happening?
Leela," Bender, please try to be a little quieter."
Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes. Fished to death. Just about the time your people arrived on Earth wasn't it, Zoidberg?"
Bender, It's a fake place.
Bender, 1947 can kiss my shiny metal--
Fry, Woo! I've been through the adventure of a lifetime. Ow!
Bender," Yeah! Alright! Yeah, yeah, baby!"
Farnsworth," He proved that 50 years ago, and he's been coasting on it ever since."
Farnsworth," Ooh, that's good news! You know, you really don't cook enough roasts, Leela. Women!"
Leela, Lieutenant Kroker!
Fry, That clover helped my ratfink brother steal my dream of going into space. Now I'll never get there.
Bender, You gave me a twenty.
Bender," Pick up the pace, lady! I'm sick of shaking my booty for these fat jerks. I didn't mean you're all fat. Just fatso there."
Leela, Hi-yah!
Farnsworth," I'm afraid not, son. Petroleum only forms when organic matter is subjected to intense pressure for hundreds of millions of years."
Leela," I didn't wanna leave them either, Fry, but what are we supposed to do?"
Leela, Are you crazy? It's a can of old fish.
Fry," Well, yank my beard. This be a surprise."
Farnsworth," Oh, yes, we must, yes."
Fry," Negative, bossy meat creature. I know now what my primary function is  I am a battle-droid. Sworn to protect the weak from crazy robots."
Bender, Shotgun!
Fry," Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?"
Leela, No. I'm not attracted to bullies. No matter how big and ... ... handsome they are.
Zoidberg," Listen to me, Fry. Just because you think you're a robot, doesn't make you a robot. After all, I think I'm a doctor but that doesn't make me a doctor. These fancy clothes do!"
Farnsworth, I don't feel well!
Hermes, None of your beeswax!
Amy," Thank you for coming, everyone. We're all having some good, clean fun here."
Leela," Wow. I feel so lucky just to have been nominated alongside so many inferior shows. And, to all my young friends at the Orphanarium, thank you for inspiring me to be your hero."
Farnsworth," Well, uh, that depends what's on."
Bender, I die happy knowing you fell for that.
Fry," Don't you worry about ""blank"". Let me worry about ""blank""."
Fry," I don't belong here, Bender. This is an asylum for insane robots!"
Farnsworth," Oh, the humanity! Also Bender!"
Farnsworth," Folks, the situation is grim but we shall prevail, thanks to you, our crack team of loyal dregs!"
Fry, Aye.
Leela," Continuing my confession, this is the hardest thing I've ever done."
Fry, This is awesome! I've been waiting a thousand years to see a Beastie Boys show.
Bender," Thanks, Nixon. How we doing?"
Fry," Oh, uh, but I don't want to."
Fry, I'll bet I can get as many followers as you without sinking to your level.  What do you say?  First one to a million followers wins a buck.
Bender," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Leela," Fry, face it  The moon is a dump. It's a boring, dried-up wasteland and the only reason anybody ever comes here is for the tacky little amusement park. Can't you just accept that?"
Hermes, Huddled together in fear like lice in a burning wig.
Amy," Where are you going, Bender?"
Fry, What? No!
Farnsworth, Louder! Louder! Crybaby.
Fry," Bees make honey and jelly? Huh. How come nothing humans make tastes good? Help! I can't swim in jelly, as far as I know!"
Fry," Places, everyone."
Farnsworth," Well, Leela, care to give the What-If machine a whirl?"
Bender, Alright! Turkey dog!
Zoidberg," Ah, much better. You can take off these rubber bands now."
Zoidberg, I watch TV with that guy!
Farnsworth, Neither did I— Ooh.
Hermes," Number 1.0, I hereby petition you for an emergency sort-and-file, under regulation 2 point--"
Leela," Not you. Aww, poor baby chipped a fang."
Fry," Nope. Straight line. Ah, the Probulator's done."
Leela, I can. As long as I don't have to parallel park.
Amy, Hi!
Leela, We all figured that out.
Leela, Just shut up and bring me two dinners.
Bender," Hey, that punk stole our hood ornament. Now no one will know we have the LX package."
Amy," Oh, no!"
Zoidberg," Bender, old friend. What's on your face?"
Farnsworth," There, there."
Leela, Bender's in his office.
Farnsworth, We could use my new invention  A pointy rock tied to a stick.
Farnsworth," Only one. We'll have to travel deep inside Fry, in this!"
Bender," Well I don't know anything about lifting, so that just leaves us the one option."
Farnsworth," I just told you, you've killed me!"
Leela, No!
Hermes, Please don't do that.
Leela, Ew!
Zoidberg, Wahoo!
Leela, You just assume I can't get a Valentine's date?
Bender," It's one thing to win a fixed fight; there's dignity in that. But to lose? And in this atrocity? I can't do it! Leela, you gotta train me to win."
Zoidberg, A fancy dress gala! I'll wear my formal shell.
Zoidberg, That's where I live. I have no home.
Leela, Where are we?
Farnsworth," As soon as we finish cleaning Bender. Oh, and Fry, this is our intern, Amy Wong. She's an engineering student of mine. I like having her around because she's the same blood type as me."
Leela," Ooh, look! You taped up the cracks in the dark matter reactor."
Fry, And ... cut!
Leela," Alright, Zookeeper. What do you want?"
Leela," Now it's daylight, so he should be in robot form. But be careful  Many robots are stupid and violent."
Leela, Not exactly. Aha! You do only like me for my body.
Bender," Hmm, OK. But I'll need 10 kegs of beer, a continuous tape of Louie Louie and a regulation two-storey panty-raid ladder."
Amy, Poor Calculon.
Bender, You are not fit to wear Fry's leotard!
Fry," It is, isn't it? Wait, those are the ads."
Fry, You named your boil Susan?
Leela," Hey, Bender, I thought you said you were in this episode."
Farnsworth, It will if we go back in time and stop him!
Farnsworth," I don't remember much, buddy. And you're no looker!"
Fry, I don't know how you did that.
Fry, Oh! I didn't need to hear that.
Amy, Really? Honest and true?
Farnsworth," Oh, no!  The light!  I guess I'm off to Hell."
Bender, Set course for Earth!
Leela, Zoidberg.
Bender," And me, Mighty Merchandise Robot!"
Bender, It's my booties from when I was a kid.
Leela," Bender, quick! Waggle something!"
Fry, You wouldn't. Ask anyway.
Hermes, My God! He never took middle school hygiene. He never saw the propaganda film.
Bender, Curse my natural showmanship!
Leela, You could really use a shower.
Leela, I don't know which I'm more  Enraged or disgusted.
Fry, Eck!
Fry, Huh? Ooh! How do you do?
Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for, uh ... ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud! I always thought at this point in my life I'd be the one making the crank calls! Here's to another lousy millennium."
Bender," On the count of three, you will awaken feeling refreshed, as if Futurama had never been cancelled by idiots, then brought back by bigger idiots. 1... 2...."
Bender, Vintage Bubblegum!
Fry, Leela?  Leela Leela?
Fry," Oh, it's just that I love Leela something awful. Do you think a space-age dame like her would ever marry a two-bit, low-life delivery boy like me an' also I 'ave bad posture and severe financial problems?"
Hermes, Only the staff doctor. You'll have to convince him that you have resolved your anger issues.
Fry," Shut up, you two! We can kill ourselves when we get home!"
Fry," Hmm, you got any sacred artwork of her from the back?"
Hermes," Hey, mon."
Leela," Fry, sometimes in close quarters, people do inconsiderate things without realising it."
Fry," Hey, gimmie a break! What do you do with it?"
Bender, Futurama!
Fry," I didn't do it. Bender, did you learn a lesson about not bein' lazy while the rest of us were bombed out of our gourds?"
Farnsworth, Fix it!
Fry, Sayonara.
Zoidberg," Yes, listen to the father."
Fry," Oh, okay. I foot-swear."
Zoidberg," Says you, salaryman!"
Amy, The buggalo! They're in the crater.
Fry, Roman numerals? I've got it! We're in Rome.
Fry, Look out! He's got a bezeling planisher!
Fry, And what does it look like?
Fry, It just needs some gas.
Fry," Thank you, sir. That's exactly what I was going for."
Bender," Are you on the junk, Fry? Why are you wasting time on a creature of inferior intelligence?"
Zoidberg, No! Look!
Leela," Oh, you don't mean that. Love can surprise you at any time in your life."
Bender, Overruled. The choice of champions is Pabst Blue Robot!
Leela, Me too!
Fry," I'm telling you, there's something about Flexo I don't like."
Hermes," I will now read the mandatory speech. Dear employee. Has it really been five, 10 or 15 years? If not, please disregard this and get back to work. Distribute token of appreciation and applaud."
Fry," Bender, what is it?"
Fry, Yeah!
Leela," It's OK. You're lonely and I'm lonely. But, together, we're lonely together."
Farnsworth," Why, you're that disgraced starship captain. Having him on staff will distract people from our horrendous safety record. Come in."
Bender, There. Now no one will forget how I lived or my attitude regarding butt.
Bender," Wow! Hitting the same place three times? I admire your style, Roberto."
Fry, This is all my fault. I let my best friend risk his life just to get my dead dog back. Bender!
Leela, Do you have any gum?
Farnsworth," No harm done. In the many decades you'll work to repay me for that shipment of popcorn you destroyed, you'll have plenty of time to search for your true home."
Fry," Oh, no! Poor Bender."
Fry, I would never shoot Bender! Never! He taught me how to shave.
Bender," Good evening, I'm-- Whoa, sorry. I'm Bender and I'll be emceeing this roast. Y'know, they say you can judge a man by the company he keeps. So here's the Professor's oldest friend, a grotesque, stinking lobster."
Bender," Well, let's see what kinda things this body can do. Hey, that's pretty fun. Being human is great!"
Farnsworth, Why certainly.
Fry," Careful, Leela! He knows less about Human anatomy than I do. And I can't even find my own uterus!"
Bender, What for?
Zoidberg," This letter has to be very personal, so I'm writing it in my own ink. Dear Uncle Zoid, greetings from your long-lost nephew. Norm and Sam and Sadie's boy, remember?"
Fry, You're OK!
Leela, The mouth's too dangerous. I'm going for the nose.
Leela," Thanks, Fry. It's nice to have the support of viewers like you."
Fry, It is?
Leela," Well, sure. I mean ... not really. I mean ... nature will work itself out. It can't screw things up any worse than we did trying to fix things, right?"
Bender, Me! Thank God you've come!
Leela," We can't wait for Bender. It's time for a woman's touch. Yah! Hi-yah! Yah, yah, yah!"
Bender," Well, if they're is one thing I learned, it's a lesson. I believe this belongs to you."
Farnsworth, Zai jian.
Fry," Whoa, it kind of takes your breath away."
Zoidberg, He's so talented!
Amy, I'm Amy. The Professor and I switched bodies.
Farnsworth," He always seemed so full of life; laughing, singing, begging for scraps. And now this."
Bender," Uh, no, thanks. I'm good."
Farnsworth, I knew I should have shown him Electro Gonorrhoea  The Noisy Killer.
Leela, Just go to your stupid party. We can have dinner on my birthday some other year.
Fry, Mmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a thousand years of progress  A Bavarian cream dog that's also self-microwaving!
Bender," Ah, those things cost more lives than they save."
Leela, Of course it is. But you don't have to laugh!
Fry, Is it a ghost?!
Leela, It's not crap.
Fry," Yeah, they're great, huh?"
Farnsworth," Go, Planet Express!"
Hermes, The shot was too good! We're jamming straight for the hole.
Fry, You!
Bender," Uh-huh. Helping my defective brothers is the first thing I've ever cared about, even the slightest bit. You know, when I first got broken, I thought my life was over. But look at me now  I've got fame, money, groupies, and it's all thanks to being completely immobilised. That's why I'll be proud to go up on stage tomorrow and say, ""Look at me, world, I am a broken robot!""."
Bender," Why, God? Why 'ave I been singled out?"
Leela, This society is a bunch of idiots.
Leela," Not really. It's highly volatile Dark Matter, and some corn."
Bender," See, buddy? It's not so scary."
Hermes," Pick up ladies on your own time, you shiny-headed goat!"
Leela, Forget about Fry. You can hire us back and he'd never have to know.
Farnsworth," My anti-backwards crystal. So it's you three. I should have known Mom would send her brainless brood to do her dirty work. Walt, the leader among imbeciles."
Leela, It's pulling us under! Everyone into the ship!
Leela," Two, three-- Hey!"
Bender," Oh oh oh oh oh oh! Masters, if I might, let me do the stealing. I'll go to the past and snatch everything I can get my greasy mitts on. Then, as a robot, I could just wait it out for a few centuries in the limestone cavern beneath this building. Oh, it'll be ever so much fun."
Fry, Hank Aaron XXIV? How could you play so blowfully? The original Hank Aaron was great!
Amy," Fry, we brought someone to cheer you up."
Leela, You used to say that all the time!
Fry," Hey, look! Anchovies!"
Amy, No! No!
Farnsworth, Not helping him.
Farnsworth," Now, you'll only have one chance to destroy the ball. After that, it will be so close to Earth that blowing it up would cause garbage to rain over the entire planet, killing billions."
Leela, To keep the lamp light burning or to help the latkes broil?
Amy," Oh, no! He sand-crabbed out!"
Farnsworth," Bubblegum, look at this. The background time radiation is fluctuating wildly."
Zoidberg," Wait! Everyone must know  I broke the Professor's bottled ship. And what is worse, I framed my dearest friend, Fry! I can never repay him his ten dollars, so I must take the only honourable path. What the killing myself. Here I go, already. Huh?"
Bender, Done.
Fry, What the hell's going on? I thought you were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.
Bender," You're my best friend, Fry, I'm sorry I treated you so badly."
Zoidberg, We're not unemplo --
Bender," Oh, how I wish I could believe or understand that! There's only one reasonable course of action now  Kill Flexo. Ow!"
Bender, Halt. Who goes there?
Amy, Wait. This isn't a real Bender. It's a talking doll from when Bender had that sitcom about the city Robot who moves back to the farm.
Hermes, Company? How cute! What will you be pedalling? Lemonade? Shoe shines? Cootie insurance?
Fry," Great food, huh?"
Fry," Oh, good, a physical! Once they examine my fragile, naked, pink body, they'll see I'm not a--"
Zoidberg," Yes, fuff. How can I ever repay you?! Do you need a slave? Or maybe a butler?"
Farnsworth, My God! This is the greatest mystery of all time. We must fly to Rome and exhume the body of Saint James.
Fry, I'll come visit sometime. And you can visit me here.
Bender," Hell, no!"
Farnsworth," Greedy old hag, taste the wrath of my fuzzy slipper."
Leela," I have to admit, I was afraid you wouldn't make it."
Farnsworth," Oh, my, no."
Zoidberg, I could make the costumes.
Bender," Stay beautiful, doll-face! That Probulator sure knows how to please a man. So, what's for lunch?"
Hermes, This was one hell of a bus.
Fry, So do I get Seymour back? Are you caving to political pressure?
Bender," Warning, perform virus scan? I'm waiting for porn over here."
Zoidberg," Young lady, I'm an expert on humans. Now pick a mouth, open it and say... What? My mother was a saint! Get out!"
Fry, In my time we didn't depend on high-tech gadgets like you do. We didn't need a mechanical washing unit to wash our clothes. We just used a washing machine. And look  You don't need an electric can-opener to feed yourself. All you need is a trusty Swiss Army knife. Ow! I'm hungry!
Bender, Who is that God-like figure?
Leela, I love this time of day. There's such a beautiful stillness.
Fry," Hey, yeah."
Fry, Can I have another hug?
Leela," OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
Fry, But that doesn't make it any less meaningful!
Leela, How'd you do it? Drugs in the champagne? Hypnosis?
Leela," Please, officers, there's no need to use force."
Hermes, You incompetent crab!
Farnsworth," Oh, fuff! Why bother remembering anything? You're just going to forget it five seconds later."
Farnsworth," Okay, granted, that one missing link is still missing, but just because we haven't found it doesn't mean it doesn't exist!"
Farnsworth," Careful with that, you fool! No! No! But possibly yes."
Leela," Oh, alright."
Fry, The day I got frozen? What about it?
Fry," Ow, ow! Ah!"
Fry," If those aren't tears of happiness, please stop crying."
Bender, I could pound your head till you think that's what happened.
Bender," And the awkward meter goes up another notch. Ding, ding, ding, ding ding..."
Leela, Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age of 25.
Fry," Uh, not everything."
Leela, And Bender?
Bender," Ah, this trip is turning into a big letdown."
Farnsworth," Your grandfather? Stay away from him, you dim-witted monkey! You mustn't interfere with the past. Don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to do it. In which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!"
Leela," I can't believe you ratted me out, Fry."
Leela," He ought to be with all the strict training I've been putting him through. Nibbler, roll over and you get a ham. Roll over. Roll over for the ham. You are so adorable! Who wants a ham?"
Fry," No, you have a healthy glow."
Amy," Look, Kif, I probably am the mother. Although maybe I'm not. Of course, I hope I am. But just in case I'm not, maybe we should have a test."
Leela, This is unbelievable. The old Bender never would have taken us out to dinner.
Leela, And sing a whaling tune. We're whalers on the moon--
Bender," I know not of this Bender. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood."
Hermes, Sweet lion of Zion! Look at the Professor go.
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! I've invented a device that allows you to operate equipment from great distances. I call it ""the fing-longer"". Observe. And, here we go. There!"
Zoidberg," Oh, Danny-boy--"
Bender," and  ...for outdated pants,"
Leela, Thank God!
Leela, Why did you do all that stuff?
Bender, I told Fry you were dead so he would cry out the Emperor but you had to go and wreck it by surviving.
Leela," Sure, why not?"
Bender," Your best is an idiot. Let's pick it up, people. So far it's been crap after crap! I croaked, now show me some love!"
Amy," Aw, you always say just the wrong thing in just the right way."
Leela," Give it up, Fry! I've got to pop these tops in a precise order."
Zoidberg, You! You saved my life!
Zoidberg, Not to mention those single socks from the dryer. Am I right?
Amy," You can do it, Kif!"
Leela, Fry? Are you there?
Hermes," Hey, mon!"
Bender, I love you too. Get that stupid chip out of me before I kill myself!
Bender, You do not!
Amy," You're so stinky, you need right guard and left guard."
Bender," Ah, don't get your hopes up. We're a billion miles from nowhere."
Bender," So then I said, ""See you at the fight."" And that's the story."
Bender, Ooh! I'm gonna wash my linen so hard the w-- You--!
Fry, Wait a second! Maybe your futuristic Xmas isn't so rotten after all.
Fry, Bender? Bender?
Bender," Aw! Here's a little song I wrote to cheer you up. It's called, Let's go already!"
Bender,"   We've got a right to pick a little fight with rustlers, Somebody wants to pick a fight with us, He'd better bite my ass!"
Farnsworth, Toss me the speech centre of the brain!
Hermes, Barbados Slim?
Leela, What's the secret of time travel doing on Fry's ass?
Bender," Yes, I will."
Zoidberg, Friends! Friends! I've got barnacles on my tuchus!
Farnsworth, Fuf! Superstitious robot mumbo-jumbo.
Leela, Time for a diap-y change!
Farnsworth, What's the use? I'm just not capable of the happiness of the dumb. If only I'd made some mistake!
Bender, It's like he's not him anymore. You took away his robo-humanity. I changed my mind!
Zoidberg, It sounds like something I would say.
Bender," Fry! Stop doing the right thing, you jerk!"
Hermes," Say, I'm no physicist, but I think I know how to stop the skipping. We'll just--"
Leela, Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?
Fry," Oh, yeah!"
Bender," Listen, buddy, I'm in a hurry here. Let's try for a two-fer!"
Fry, All right! We can go home!
Bender," Way to go, squishy!"
Fry, Pack of highly. Got it!
Zoidberg," I should warn you, I'm a mean drunk."
Fry, Eh?
Zoidberg," Many people dream of a fresh, new look. And Mary Kay can make those dreams come true."
Zoidberg," Oh, it's wonderful! I don't know anything about it but they give me a bucket of krill for every patient I send."
Fry," Well, I think the Robot Devil said he'd loved me in Bender's voice, wearing Granny Hester's clothes. I wanna go home!"
Leela," Goodbye, Fry."
Leela, What?
Fry," Nice kick, me."
Fry, Hey! You burned my cheek!
Farnsworth," Show us this ""the wheel""."
Farnsworth," Now we get back to work. And if that means destroying an ecosystem or two, so be it."
Leela, Well just remember we all still have to work together. So try and let her down easy.
Fry," Yeah, yeah, yeah! Keep it coming! Put the pot down! Get away!"
Fry, Ten minutes late. Ain't that just like a womanista?
Amy, I'm fine.
Fry, Fine!
Farnsworth," No, I remembered that I'd built one last year. Go ahead, try it. You'll find that every heavenly body has its own particular scent. Here, I'll point it at Jupiter."
Fry," Oh, stop!"
Bender," Ten more processors for me. Once I install these, I'll have access to the loftiest realms o' thought!"
Fry," No! They did it! They blew it up! And then the apes blew up their society too. How could this happen? And then the birds took over and ruined their society. And then the cows. And then... ... I don't know, is that a slug, maybe? Noooo!"
Fry," Wow! I must say, I'm impressed. You look just like a ball player. Can I pat you on the butt?"
Leela," Space bandidos have been operating in this quadrant so you'll each take 8-hour shifts guarding the safe. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
Hermes," When I gave up diapers, my parents promised exactly this would never happen!"
Leela," On Xmas Eve, we don our gay apparel, Kevlar vests, asbestos stockings and a barrel."
Leela," Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. Ready for your big trip to the surface?"
Amy," Oh, no! This could be the year without a Kwanzaa, like every year before 1966."
Leela, Sh!
Farnsworth, No. A tax-deductible mission of charity.
Fry, What the--
Fry," The diamond still didn't break! Now, you'll never know 'ow much I love you. It went kersplitters!"
Leela," Oh, following in my footsteps?"
Bender," Once, when I took those hostages."
Amy, Shut up. You're distracting me.
Bender," ""Fry"" who?"
Bender," I dunno, I'm feeling pretty good about it."
Leela, Holy matrimony! That's one flashy rock!
Leela," Bender, dating your co-worker and primary mode of transportation is immoral, illogical and a violation of interstellar shipping statute 437-B."
Leela," How can you make fun of me, Kirk? You're blind!"
Bender," Party on, Slurms!"
Leela, What?
Farnsworth," Aw. I suppose there's nothing left to do but move out. Leela, Amy, pack us a lunch for our new lives under the bridge while us men reminisce and smoke some stogies."
Fry," You're right. I'm never gonna see him again. I know he was evil and on more than one occasion he-he actually stole my blood. But still, I wish I had Bender back."
Leela," Ow! Hey, watch it!"
Fry, What?
Leela, Check inside the cap. There might be a caked-in goldmine.
Farnsworth, Wernstrom!
Fry," Woo! Yeah! Hit him, hit him, hit him! Now this is the high life; watching apes mangle each other near celebrities."
Leela, I've been ashamed of Susan as long as I can remember.
Fry," Thank you, sir."
Bender," The fact is, humans are completely harmless."
Amy," Yeah, isn't that basically all Jamaicans do?"
Amy, Yay!
Leela," Yay, Kif!"
Bender," Ah, US presidents. Sturdy shelves, good security. This place has class."
Leela," What a skank. Anyway, Planet Express is still facing foreclosure. There's no way we can raise enough money to save this company."
Bender," Time is money, peaches. Now shut your com link and make love to the camera. And remember  I'm the camera. Stop actually washin' and play with the sponges!"
Amy," That's Bender, alright."
Fry, Why would robots vote for Nixon now that he's just a head in a jar?
Fry, Well...
Fry, Not beautiful enough! A swell gal like you deserves better!
Amy, I heard she took a job selling deep-space real estate. Somewhere beyond the most distant thing ever observed with a telescope.
Leela," You shut up, too."
Bender, Your company promotes wrong love! If you don't shut down right now the only thing wired about you will be your jaw!
Zoidberg," Been there, done that."
Amy," It's jewelry. Jewelry! It's jewelry, people!"
Fry," He must have used a sleep-ray on me. Sleep-rays exist in the future, right?"
Leela, Shhh!
Farnsworth, Some say I'm robbing the cradle but I say she's robbing the grave.
Fry, I'm experienced at foraging. I used to find edible mushrooms on my bath mat.
Zoidberg," Good evening, ladies and germs. That wasn't a joke, I was talking to Dean Streptococcus. Now, I'm not saying Professor Farnsworth is old, but if you consider his age, he's likely to die soon. Hey, Ringo, that was the joke. Oh, it's Showtime at the Apollo all over again."
Hermes," Oh... You cookin' me back bacon. Thank you, woman."
Leela," Hey, you guys, look what I bought on a wild impulse  New boots. They're like my old ones but with a crazy green stripe. Woo! Never know what I'm gonna do next!"
Leela, Feeling responsible for your death was driving me mad. But now everything is alright.
Fry, I made you some trail mix for the flight. Also this picture to remember me by.
Farnsworth," Congratulations, Dr. Wong!"
Fry," Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish she didn't make us work so much."
Fry, $1200?
Bender, Wow! Your kid is great. How hard did you say you had to hit him?
Fry," Oh, jeez, get a room!"
Fry," I can't watch this 'cause it's creepy and wrong and sick. However, I will watch out of curiosity."
Fry," Great list. Except, you forgot episode 66!"
Zoidberg," And the winner is... And the winner, instead of any of the nominees, is the legendary Harold Zoid!"
Farnsworth," Bender, fetch me that powdered opal!"
Fry, 14!
Hermes," People, it's Valentine's Day next week, so your beloved company has gotten you all new uniforms."
Bender, Pst! Fry! Stop interfering with history. I don't wanna have to memorise a lot of new kings when I get back.
Bender," Oh, I don't feel good."
Amy, You sure picked it.
Bender," Oh, there's gotta be a better way."
Fry, That's not true.
Hermes," According to Google Hive, we're at the exact center of the honeycomb. Oh! And there's a Jamba Juice point 2 miles that way."
Fry," Man, the Professor's been in his lab for days."
Leela, The animals.
Hermes, Thank God I'm free of that nightmare!
Fry," Oh, yeah? Then I challenge you to a romantic dinner at Elzar's tonight."
Farnsworth," I'm sorry, Og, but I've got a new crew."
Fry, Alright!
Amy, Is Nibbler stoked for the big pet show?
Leela, The engine's stalled. I'm trying the manual fuel pump.
Leela, You don't understand. He would never hurt people. Let us help you capture him.
Bender," I was thinking ""Benderbrau"" if it's an ale, ""Botweiser"" if it's a lager."
Bender," We thank you, Bender, for the gift we are about to receive."
Bender, Bigger! Bigger!
Leela," Fry stood me up and died? I'm so angry. I mean, I'm so sad. But I'm still pretty angry. But also sad. Can I be both?"
Hermes," Oh, you don't want that!"
Fry," Leela, we want you to be captain again."
Zoidberg," Sorry, I get aroused in crowds."
Zoidberg, No!
Leela," Well, looks like Flexo got away clean."
Farnsworth, Yes. But I'll always love her in my own subtle way.
Hermes, It's a triumph of free-spirited German engineering.
Bender, Deploying ice drill.
Fry, That should have been me!
Bender," Well, this is embarrassing. Here I've been blabbing on for years about killing all humans, and who actually does something about it? Some chick."
Leela," Hmm, I'd better check the fluid levels. We're OK on Coke syrup."
Leela, Come on. I have a better idea.
Fry," Wow, Colleen, you look so beautiful in the light of the swamp gas."
Amy, We're also Santa Claus.
Fry," Just say her sweet goofbag is working to save the violet dwarf star, just like she is."
Hermes, I'm afraid I do. I order you dispose of that toxic waste properly or bribe me. Either way it'll cost $500.
Farnsworth," Yes, relative to you, it was eons, but, well, look at this hologram I took the day before yesterday of a robot frolicking with a robo-dinosaur."
Fry, What's pink pocodots?
Bender," I'll walk you out. After all, a true gentleman tends to his date's every need. Tiparillo?"
Farnsworth," Long ago, Zoidberg an' I entered into a secret arrangement relating to certain extraordinary events too horrible to reveal. So there's nothing to be curious about!"
Fry, Thank you.
Amy," Look, it's Leela."
Fry, Now here's a party I can get excited about. Sign me up!
Fry, Can I ask you a question?
Leela," So, what you think you just explained to us is that--"
Leela," Professor, maybe there's some way to bring the pine trees back to life, like we did with the barking snakes."
Farnsworth, Mush! Mush!
Leela,So you did kill Frida Waterfall?
Zoidberg, I guess we should have waited in the ship.
Fry," Yay, Bender!"
Fry," Yet the Zookeeper escaped, thus proving that the deadliest animal of all is the Zookeeper."
Leela, Roger.
Fry," Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Put me in, Professor. I wanna show Leela my skills."
Hermes, I am right.
Fry," Hey, which crazy thing happening are you guys screaming about?"
Leela, We're pushing as hard as we can.
Leela," You know I hate lying. But those orphans were so proud of me, I couldn't bear to let them down."
Fry," It's called a van, and in light of the fact that it's not a-rockin', I invite you to come a-knockin'!"
Leela, El Chupanibre? What's that?
Bender," Don't worry, guys, I'll never be too good or too evil again. From now on, I'll just be me."
Farnsworth, The main pit must be in here. I'm detecting vast quantities of Dark Matter.
Bender, Amen!
Bender, I know I am.
Bender, All I ever wanted was for people to remember my name. It's Bender.
Bender," No further answers, Your Honor."
Fry," No, 'e wouldn't. Bender doesn't care about us anymore."
Fry," Do we have to? I mean, they're monks. I'm sure their God will let them out or at least give them more shoes to eat."
Leela," Oh, totally.  This thing's hands-free.  That's how I can eat this taco and this spaghetti."
Fry," Junk? Maybe you can't understand this, but I've finally found what I need to be happy and it's not friends, it's things."
Zoidberg," Give it to me straight, Professor. Is it fin rot? It's fin rot, isn't it? Tell me it's not fin rot!"
Fry," That's true. How about you, Amy?"
Fry, Little twerp.
Bender," Sorry, but we're totally sealed in. Nothing can get in or out. Except millions of snakes. Here, have a pomegranate schnapps from my private distillery and start sharing fond memories of me, Bender."
Zoidberg, UNKNOWN! Hey. What's that bone-sucking sound?
Fry, And then we can go home.
Leela," Come on, Fry! Get it!"
Leela, Zoidberg is dead!
Leela, The Mets? Those bums are worse than me.
Fry, No.
Fry, Leela! Stop bonding and let's go! I got jelly in my underpants!
Hermes, You said you knew he didn't care about us!
Leela," Yes, we know."
Zoidberg, Edna? Honey?
Bender," Oh, my God!"
Fry," Come on, Leela, what's the real reason you won't go out with me?"
Fry, I can make a space experiment. I just got a new thing o' glitter!
Bender," Why not, indeed?"
Bender," Boo! Hahahaha. Naw, it's just me, Bender."
Fry, So thirsty.
Bender, I dunno. I'm beginning to have some second thoughts--
Fry," Ah, no one likes them at first but they'll grow on you."
Bender, Neat!
Bender," Great, I'll make Hot Pockets."
Farnsworth, Dear Lord! You've all reverted to your childhood forms.
Zoidberg, Pfff. Himalayan or Neptunian?
Farnsworth," So, how was delivery to Fantasy Planet, where everyone's fantasies come to life?"
Fry," Oh, I don't know. Hey, Professor, what are you teaching this semester?"
Farnsworth, The Queen? Sounds most satisfactory. All of you out!
Leela, Mutants! They're real!
Bender, They must just wanna see that episode. Let's find a tape and give it to 'em.
Fry," ""You must be at least this naked""? How much nakeder could you be?"
Bender," I hate partying!  If only I didn't have so much crunk in my badunkadunk!  Ooh, yeah! Come on, babe!"
Fry," Oh, no! My ATM card! My secret PIN number -- 1077. I've got nothing left. Except..."
Fry," Eating a sweet, innocent chick before it's even hatched?! Oh-ho-ho-ho, no, you won'tn't! I refuse to eat an unborn animal! I'm gonna keep this egg safe and warm and secure. Until it hatches out into the world. And then I'm gonna eat it!"
Leela, Why is there so little traffic around Earth?
Bender, Perhaps they speak perfect English... As do we.
Leela, It's the Parade Day parade.
Farnsworth, Indeed so. This whole area will be incinerated when he implodes that sun there into a black hole.
Leela, Then what about these angels? Some kind of Scooby Doo-esque flashlight projection?
Fry, This is so unfair! I liked you back when you were a cyclops! That guy's only interested now that you have two eyes.
Fry," Wow! Thanks, Hermes! I-- Hey! Cut that out!"
Leela," Hey, look. It's our old group picture."
Bender, Who put this in here?
Bender," Fry, it doesn't mean anything. I have love enough for two."
Leela," Whatever happened here, that first crew left in a hurry. The table is still set from McDonald's value dinner!"
Fry, Yeah.
Bender, Slurms MacKenzie?
Leela, Second.
Bender," You seem a tad wound up, buddy. And your face is greasy. Real greasy! You been up all night?"
Bender," Woohoo! Yeah, alright!"
Farnsworth," That's right. Animals in desperate need of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once filled with a super-dense substance known as dark matter, each pound of which weighs over ten thousand  pounds."
Leela," Hello, there. Hmm. He doesn't seem to be on the checklist."
Bender," But going through a divorce together, you can't tell me that didn't bring us closer. Care to dance?"
Farnsworth," Oh, don't be so sure. Many scientists believe humans really could mutate down there. Uh, due to exposure to toxic waste and radioactive run-off and good old American faeces!"
Leela," How interesting, Dr. Zoidberg. Do go on."
Leela," Oh, I can't take it! Mom, Dad, I'm Clobberella!"
Bender, It's used to it!
Leela, Shoot her!  She's the robot!
Leela," Wait! He pled ""not guilty""."
Zoidberg," Don't stop, Professor. I'm getting aroused."
Bender," Oh, yeah! Bam it again, Elzar! Knock it up another notch!"
Zoidberg, I was just trying to—
Bender," Oh, come on. I'm not gonna say it. Please? Ooh, is it ""please""?"
Farnsworth," Oh, foo!"
Bender, Both of them?! You mean you'll do two things and I only have to do one thing?
Leela," Okay, we've got shelter and just enough precious food to ward off starvation."
Amy," Take me back, Kif?"
Zoidberg," Yeah, I know."
Leela," Fry, if I drop dead from exhaustion, make sure my body freezes in a dignified position. None of that ""huddled over for warmth"" crap."
Bender," Drive to Vegas, pick up some Flooziebots and void their warranties all night long!"
Leela," Oh, put down the binoculars, Fry. The wall of that strip club isn't going to collapse twice in one day."
Leela, Bender! Stop!
Farnsworth, Oh!
Fry, I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse. I asked you to get busy.
Fry," Ooh, can I somehow charge it to my eyePhone for an additional fee?"
Farnsworth, All attempts to communicate with the Aliens have failed. I fear our only option is thrilling space battle.
Amy," Hey, yeah! I mean ... what about that, Kif?"
Bender," Hey, let's see what it says about me."
Leela, I guess this is a... Not so bad. As long as we don't need to use our mental... Mental...
Fry, You're on Fry-time. Leela! Did you get my message?
Farnsworth," No, don't get your hopes up. Frankly, she's just a brainless mound of scabs and pus."
Bender," Goody, goody, goody, goody!"
Bender, What the--?
Leela," Let's do it.  I shall become the mother of a new world, trapped here under this tree. The Tree of Knowledge!  Look, it even has apples! Ow! Wow! Come here, Adam, partake of my forbidden fruit."
Amy," So, is it true you can make all kinds of shirts and ropes out of hemp?"
Fry, What's wrong?
Hermes," Ready, Freddy!"
Fry," But, should superheroes commit a crime, even to save lives? I need moral guidance. Bender?"
Fry," Well, yeah. Robots are made of metal."
Fry," Well, why couldn't you just ask me?"
Bender, Don't try and talk me out of it! Well?
Farnsworth, We're in. We're in the heart of the mine. The very source of all Mom's wealth and...
Farnsworth," That's why we need you, our loyal crew, to make Planet Express 800% more profitable."
Fry, Gho—
Fry, A Robot ghost?! What Robot would wanna haunt me?
Leela, No. But I bet it wasn't someone who was good at stealing.
Fry," I've got to redeem myself. Somehow, sometime, for some reason. I'll block this takeover!"
Leela, And I'm really happy I have that life back.
Farnsworth," We're dedicated, yes!"
Leela," I don't think any of us can understand how those poor, oil-drenched penguins feel."
Bender," Check out the glowing freaks. It's beautiful! Hey, what's that?"
Hermes," Go get it, boy!"
Bender, I don't know. It wasn't here when I took your umbrella. What? I put sunblock on you.
Bender, Div-- Huh?
Leela," It's gonna be totally awesome, Mom! You and me can bake and argue about my hairstyle hiding my pretty face. And if some kid picks on me, my dad can beat up his dad."
Bender, Sounds boring.
Fry," So I ask you, as a friend, won't you stop this deal?"
Bender," No, convicted felon."
Fry, I think I'm knowing what it's like to be a mutant.
Bender," Aw, jeez. Let's just pray I have the energy to get myself another beer. Oh, what is this, the Middle Ages?"
Leela," We don't need to beg, Bender. For God's sake, we're not veterans!"
Leela," I can be really impulsive. It just takes me a while. Alright, Professor! Let's do it. Make that machine show me what would happen if I was a little more impulsive. Just a little. Not too much."
Farnsworth, About 12 hours ago when the party started.
Leela, I'm worried. It shouldn't take this long to get to second base.
Bender, Sure. Let me just.
Fry, Eurgh!
Fry," But Bender, we're your friends."
Leela, Someone should tell him.
Farnsworth," You did? Tough luck, suckers!"
Fry," This company's on the fast track to the ""It"" list. Blast back kudos all around!"
Bender, Your mama! Now shut up and drag me to work!
Bender, No one insults the turtles!
Fry," See you later, wuvvums!"
Leela, Stop!
Leela," Thank you. But I don't care how many eyes a man has ... as long as it's less than five. All I'm looking for is a guy who's adventurous, self-confident..."
Fry," Never! (singing) A deal's a deal, Even with a dirty dealer."
Fry, Actually--
Bender," Many said I was too extreme when I first called for the annihalation of the human species, as well as some of the more cunning monkeys. But after living on Earth I can tell you that I am, if anything, too merciful!"
Fry," Good old Coney Island College! Go, Whitefish!"
Leela, Let's see. Which powers do we have? Super-strength?
Bender," Uh ... Hello, fellow bees. How's the abdomen? Swollen with nectar, I trust?"
Farnsworth, Help! Satan! You owe me!
Bender, I don't see any irony in that.
Zoidberg, Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
Amy, Wrong way!
Bender," Yeah, well, a lot of 'em were children. Anyway I should get going."
Bender," Oops. How 'bout you, baby? Wanna do it?"
Bender," Alright, a tie! I win again!!"
Fry, Yeah!
Leela," Well, that's not so bad."
Fry," Well, Bender, I hope this has taught you a lesson about changing your sex to win five gold medals."
Leela," Well, there's worse places to be marooned.  Plenty of food, mild climate."
Bender," Whoa, hold on! How about inviting us in for a traditional glass of hard cider?"
Amy," Yeah. I mean we all have commercials in our dreams but you don't see us running off to buy brand-name merchandise at low, low prices."
Leela," So Flexo and Angle-ine had sex right there on the factory floor? Well, at least you got bending out of your system."
Bender, Preparing to terminate Philip Fry.
Bender," You know, playing you all for chumps?"
Fry, What's that weird sound?
Leela, If I didn't know better I'd almost think he was abusing electricity.
Leela, You guys distract the were-car and I'll kill it by plugging its exhaust pipe with this silver potato.
Bender, Woo! I love that old bat!
Zoidberg, Okay.
Fry, I guess that just leaves you and your fake fianc´ ... all alone ... on a romantic cruise.
Leela, You poor baby. Let me check if you have a fever. Ow!
Hermes, Ah! Time for my precious 10am meeting. Where in Legoland is Leela?
Farnsworth, What?
Fry," Same as everyday, got it."
Leela," Oh, it's just a card. From the orphanarium I grew up in."
Zoidberg, Help! I'm under attack!
Fry, Pew!
Fry, But there was this gang of 10-year-olds with guns.
Bender, Ooh. Now this guy had taste!
Bender," Say, why'd you get me a subscription to the Daily Growl? That's not a reputable journal of opinion."
Leela," Fry, shut up and look at this! May cause superpowers in humans."
Leela, Well? So what? She may be different but she still deserves a good home.
Amy, Romanticorp? Are they a corporation that makes romantic stuff?
Fry, Bender? I was just not playing the holophonor.
Leela, Professor! Don't you remember what I told you?
Bender," Greetings, followers  This is Day Five of my solo kayak journey around the world.  Send. Can you believe 50,000 idiots swallow that crap? Send. Oops."
Fry, Like what?
Fry," Alright, scumwads. This one's for Bender's cocktail!"
Hermes," Misfile me under ""U"" For ""euphoric."""
Leela, No. Stop being so immature.
Amy, Ow! What's going on around here?
Fry, How badly?
Bender, Look at that worm go. Who says there are no more heroes?
Bender, No!
Bender, Me. It seemed like the least honest way to get him to pay for the movie.
Bender, That sound! It's patrol car 718! Hide him!
Hermes, So you're telling me I could fire my whole staff and hire Grunka Lunkas at half the cost?
Fry," Well I don't care if it was some dork in a costume. For one brief moment I felt the heartbeat of creation, and it was one with my own."
Fry," English, please?"
Fry," Wow! Um, can I have cuts?"
Bender," OK, I like a challenge. No ... no. Ah, I got it! I'm going to be completely honest with you, Planet Express Ship. Those women you saw me with ... were my accountants."
Amy," Oh, no!"
Zoidberg," As the candy hearts poured into the fiery quasar, a wondrous thing happened, why not. They vaporised into a mystical love radiation that spread across the universe, destroying many, many planets, including two gangster planets and a cowboy world. But one planet was at exactly the right distance to see the romantic rays, but not be destroyed by them  Earth. So all over the world, couples stood together in joy. And me, Zoidberg! And no one could have been happier unless it would have also been Valentine's Day. What? It was? Hooray!"
Bender," Of course, I will do the peace dance. But I will need 'elp."
Fry," Well, that depends on what one o' those things is. That seems like a fact worth knowing."
Amy, Can we get inside the shack? I'm wearing a belly parka!
Fry, Yo!
Zoidberg," So, do you guys know about anything else going on, because I'm totally still ready to party."
Farnsworth, Get your mind out of the gutter!
Fry, That's it! It's time for this bird to walk.
Bender, No! Ooh! It tickles!
Bender, As your God is my witness.
Leela, It's Mom!
Zoidberg, Really? I though you were the robot.
Farnsworth," You'll want to hear this, Mr. President. For we have sniffed where no man has sniffed before!"
Fry, You!
Bender," Ooh! Ooh! I wanna aks it a question! As a robot living among humans, I've never really felt accepted at parties or nude beaches. So I've always secretly wondered  What if I was 500-feet tall?"
Fry," Oh, you're welcome."
Leela," Nah, I've got a lazier idea."
Leela, I don't know. Maybe?
Hermes," Do you smell the crystal, Professor?"
Zoidberg," Alright, so you're nonchalant. Quit rubbing our noses in it."
Fry," Look, Leela, even if you heard one talk, that doesn't mean it's intelligent. I mean, parrots talk and we eat them, right?"
Fry," Duh! It says ""Colony of Maffachufetts""!"
Leela," Oh, God! What have I done?"
Leela," At least, you get the senior discount at the movies. I hate paying $14 to see Nicolas Cage solve things."
Amy," Bender, is this salt water?"
Hermes, Haile H. Selassie!
Bender," Okay, let me back up for a running start."
Bender, Wow! The interesting thing about that is
Fry, That was odd.  Where'd that singing come from?
Leela," Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know you cared about Nibbler."
Leela," Why, if it isn't my favourite head on Amy's body  Fry."
Zoidberg, Totally.
Leela, Bender!
Zoidberg," What? I'm not the Tunneling Horror. I hate that guy. Always with the tunneling. Anyway, I'm dead."
Leela, Huh. I'd never thought of it that way. So what do you do these days?
Hermes," As much as I miss 'im, he didn't really serve much purpose around here. Though he did walk Zoidberg."
Farnsworth, I've always wanted to be shot out of something. How about a quick blast after lunch.
Fry," And if that doesn't work, I got you a six-pack of champagne and a funnel."
Leela," Pretty good. I just sold a castle to the King of Space. But, somehow, I keep finding myself thinking about this place. An' things."
Leela, Oops.
Bender," Wait, what's that?"
Bender, You know what your problem is? Too much smoke in your face.
Fry," No! Drugs are for losers and hypnosis is for losers with big, weird eyebrows. I don't know what amazing thing I did you make you love me but, whatever it was, we're married now. We've got the rest of our lives to work--"
Leela," Wait!  One more bite before we begin the begetting.  Mmm, juicy.  Those nut berries you found were so salty, I—I couldn't think straight. I mean, not to belabor it, but they were as salty as that bag of trail mix Fry gave me. Exactly as salty.  Hey!  Wait a second!"
Farnsworth," No, not me. I'm too busy developing makeup for dogs. That's where the money is."
Fry," Wait, I'll be back in a minute."
Farnsworth," Better yet, I'll build someone to fill in for you. Some kind of gamma-powered mechanical monster, with freeway on-ramps for arms and a heart as black as coal..."
Bender, Too late! This is more fun!
Leela, Don't let their identical DNA fool you. They differ on some key issues.
Farnsworth," Hey, Reagan. Remember when you asked to see my family tree?"
Amy, What's that squirmal under your shirt?
Bender, That's what makes it so nasty!
Bender," Uh, I stole them from her. Yeah, that's it, call the cops."
Fry," That's right, she fraternised me!"
Leela," Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have to think about it."
Leela, Fry's alive! I have proof!
Bender, I'll be good.
Bender, I've heard worse excuses to drink. Oops!
Hermes," I am putting a stop to this, right now! Come on! We're switching bodies."
Bender, Second place? That's a fancy word for losing. You didn't stick your landing!
Hermes, Don’t fire until you see the greens of their eyes! It saves on bullets.
Leela, No.
Hermes, I was inspired by Amy.
Fry, So they're trying to learn things?
Zoidberg, Dibs on her- ohh...
Bender," Hey, I don't tell you how to tell me what to do, so don't tell me how to do what you tell me to do. Bender knows when to use finesse."
Bender," Of course not! Who are you humans and why am I pointing you to the exit? Go, go, go!"
Amy," Professor, I hope you find out what's wrong before we skip right past my birth--"
Amy, Oh! You're bad!
Fry," I was looking over there for a long time but I didn't see any... Oh, there they are. Gross."
Farnsworth, I devoted every waking minute to answering the fundamental questions of science.
Bender, What did you call me?
Bender," What do you mean I'm not registered? My name is Coilette and I'm from, uh ... Robonia! Coilette's a chick's name!"
Bender, Yeah. But only 93% as lovely as you.
Farnsworth, Who knows? Probably some hogwash about the human spirit.
Leela," No need, Lady Buggle."
Hermes," Hot damn, a day off!"
Fry," Well, actually, no. You forgot to blank our memories after you spoke last time."
Leela, Trust me. You can't change men anymore than you can change the laws of time and space.
Fry, Then we're dead meat. No one could squeeze under there!
Zoidberg, I just remembered. That's the guy! Oy! Now with the horror hair.
Bender, Huh? Tubes? You're older than you said you were!
Bender," Yeah, but everybody's a jerk. You, me, this jerk. That's my philosophy. So, where you gonna stay?"
Hermes," Two, one. And we're out of business."
Bender," C'mon now, what's new! Ew!"
Amy," Hey, let's go car shopping! My parents promised if I got all B's they'd buy me a bar, and I got all C's!"
Farnsworth," Ah, to be young again. And also a robot. Now, as I recall, you youngsters have a package to deliver."
Bender," But you'll look sweet, Upon the seat, Of a bicycle built for two."
Fry, Ready!
Fry," Sign me up for the tournament, please."
Amy, Woohoo!
Bender," No can do, Slurms!"
Bender, My story's a lot like yours only more interesting 'cause it involves robots. That jerk Elzar ruined my dream of being a chef too.
Leela, I really would like you to stop singing.
Hermes, So long.
Bender, But by far the most important thing is oil.
Fry, Is it edible?
Bender, Question.
Leela," He doesn't care about the apartment, he cares about you. And you turned your back on him."
Bender, Your wheelchair?
Fry, Please. I need something to settle my stomach.
Fry, Ow! It's hot! The butter in my pocket is melting.
Bender," Fry, as you know, there are lots of things I'm willing to kill for. Jewels, vengeance, Father O'Mally's weed whacker. But, at long last, I've found something I'm willing to die for  This mindless turtle."
Bender," Get this  For a scant $1 million investment, you can be the star."
Fry," I've still got a trick or two up my sleeve. Watch, as I fire upwards through our own shields."
Fry," Uh, excuse me? I missed a few lectures. Uh, what subject is this?"
Farnsworth, So what are you doing to protect my constitutional right to bear doomsday devices?
Fry, So where are we going anyway?
Fry," Bender, smell this milk."
Bender, Float for your lives!
Bender, Enemy invaders! Up in yonder sky!
Bender, Boo! Okay. Too bad. Goodbye.
Bender, There's a thought.
Fry," I'm going down there to get my clover back. Some of the tunnels have metal bars so I'll need someone who's good at bending. Leela, how 'bout you?"
Fry," Dude, hold up. Remember when Zapp blew a hole in the ship?"
Farnsworth, It's time to restore dignity to the Farnsworth name!
Fry," So, if I don't shoot Bender, all my other friends will die?!"
Hermes,   This is Hermes. A package just came in. Everyone is to return to the office immediately. Get away you filthy bird! Shoo! Professor turn me off quick!
Leela," Prepare for lift-off. We're out of fuel. Bender, I told you to fill the tank before we left."
Fry, Hm. Leela. But she doesn't think much of me.
Farnsworth, Wha?
Bender, ...You could not foresee...
Fry, I know but I forgive you.
Amy," Leela, maybe you should lie down."
Bender, Of course I do. Right now I feel sorry for you.
Farnsworth, One year to go. Six months.
Fry, 500!
Fry," Uh, listen, Bender. Uh, where's your bathroom?"
Bender, Nah. She'll probably make me do it.
Bender," OK, fan. Just hold still and let me get-- Whoa!"
Bender," I'll go too, with Leonard's permission, of course."
Leela, Captain--
Leela, That's crazy!
Bender, We can hide in here. It's free on Tuesdays!
Bender," Well, enough about Hermes. I couldn't win a medal either. Even at bending, the thing I was built to do. I'm so embarrassed. I wish everybody else was dead."
Fry, And it was great! We got to see craters and rocks and that one incredible rock that looked like a crater and ... and these fellas.
Bender," Wow, interesting. I'm both impressed and being eaten."
Fry, That's right.
Bender, Time to override the CPU and reprogram this Femputer.
Bender, To the flying machine!
Leela," Bender, that's great! How much did you get me?"
Fry, Thanks for covering.
Amy, You all obey a big computer?
Leela, --does the worst W.C. Fields imitation I've ever seen. Zoidberg!
Bender," Hey, check out this Internet video of some idiot crashing her spaceship!"
Leela, We're trying our best.
Farnsworth," I've booked us all on the maiden voyage of the largest, most luxurious space cruise ship ever built. The Titanic!"
Amy," 60,000!"
Fry," Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it all. Several friends, a low-paying job, a bed in a robot's closet. I envied no man. But you wrecked everything."
Bender, It's funny  Until now I always wanted to be a gangster ... so the answer's yes.
Farnsworth," Here, take my lab coat."
Bender, Fine. Yes?!
Fry," You have 50,000 followers? I only have three. Send."
Bender," Oh, my God! It's Bender! He'll save us!"
Bender," So sober, so weak..."
Hermes, There it is!
Leela," No, no. It's my fault for telling you I was a superhero."
Fry, Where?
Fry, Santa Claus is gunning you down!
Hermes, A man can give her a toke of her own medicine.
Bender, Father-o!
Fry," Stop! Thanks, Bender! Don't do it, Leela!"
Farnsworth, Nothing except and even equally big monster. This is chance to try out my experimental enlarging ray. But we'll need a guinea pig.
Leela," Yes, yes, yes."
Bender, Very well. What do they want?
Bender," Ones ... zeros ... one, one, zero, zero, one--"
Bender, You got a tattoo of me? Neat. It's like looking in a smelly mirror.
Farnsworth," No, without a backwards time machine we're stuck in this craphole."
Fry, You'd better believe it!
Zoidberg, Why?
Bender," The eyePhone records everything.  All I did was add a laugh track and twit it to my 10,000 followers."
Fry," Yeah, well, you shouldn't have been such a mean captain then."
Zoidberg, Aha!
Bender, Those times I was slightly on my side.
Fry, $30? I can't afford that. Unless... Do you take Visa?
Amy, Neat! Let's see a trick.
Farnsworth," You'll get your damned pizza, you parasite! First, let see if my Nanobots have purified the water yet. Ah, the water's as sterile as my milkman-trusting father. But what's this? The Nanobots have gotten more complex."
Fry," Hey, looky here."
Farnsworth, You were late this morning. So you'll have to stay and test my latest invention. Behold! A time travelling machine!
Leela," You mean, like my penis? Eh!"
Farnsworth, Ooh! Ooh-ho-ho!
Amy, I said everything's going to be alright.
Bender," Uh, um... I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood."
Leela, Sorry I got your boyfriend pregnant.
Bender, Don't kill me yet! I'm starting to come down with Stockholm Syndrome ... handsome!
Zoidberg," I thought I understood this world. I thought I was fitting in. But I guess I don't belong on here anymore than I belong on our crappy home planet-- Ooh, sorry."
Farnsworth," Oh, God! I clicked without reading!"
Bender," Oy, this guy."
Farnsworth," You look beautiful. Incidentally, my favourite artist is Picasso."
Leela, I don't know. Something I couldn't quite put my finger on. Possibly his vile lizard tongue.
Farnsworth," Of course she's your grandmother, you perverted dope! Look!"
Bender, Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!
Zoidberg, That one grabbed his behindus!
Amy, It would've been nice to shop at Tommy Hilfiger one last time.
Fry, It's okay. They're not going anywhere. Where'd they go?
Bender, He's a witch!
Zoidberg, Where?
Bender, Sounds like a plan! Guess I'll pass the time by lightin' up an El Jerko!
Fry," Cool, an alien! Has your race taken over the Earth?"
Leela, Uh-huh! What sorority do you belong to?
Fry, That Jeep's gonna hit him! And I won't exist anymore! Are you crazy? You almost got yourself run over!
Fry, Well I'd like to see you try and steal this. The septuple-head-spin.
Fry, Let me see. Yep. Why do you ask?
Leela, Tokens only. How does this work?
Bender," Hm, words I never say. Oh, I know! ""Thanks""!"
Farnsworth, If only there was some way I could get to the UN to help.
Fry, Alright!
Bender, It's a darn shame.
Leela, This is unbelievable. What's going on?
Bender," Nice catch, idiot!"
Bender," You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the new captain."
Amy, Ew!
Zoidberg, I was going to tan... Once.
Zoidberg, And you say these are free shovels?
Bender, No thanks. I--
Leela," In the end though, it doesn't matter who my parents were. All that matters is what I learned here, within these unscalable walls, that I have strength to make it on my own, just like all of you kids here today."
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! You'll be delivering pain medicine to the hive mind of Nigel 7."
Leela, You recorded that?
Bender," Yeah, yeah. There. Now, I'm water-cooled. I can stimulate my intellect without further thermodynamical disruptions."
Bender," So, how 'bout I work part-time at the restaurant to pay off our debt?"
Bender," Ooh! You go, mutant girl!"
Leela, And that sandwich you're eating is made of old discarded sandwiches. Nothing just gets thrown away.
Fry," I'm gonna get my puppy back! In your face, Grim Reaper!"
Bender," Hey nice seats! We're close enough so when you knock a player down with a beer bottle, he stays down!"
Fry, You're not mad?
Leela, He messed up my hair.
Farnsworth, Turn off that crap-o-rama! One mistake now and Bender will be trapped forever between the already ill-defined robot sexes.
Farnsworth, Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic Ocean. This seems the logical place for fish to congregate.
Leela," Well, I guess you deserve one more flip."
Leela, Santa! We forgot he's based on Neptune.
Bender, Who wants lobster bisque?
Hermes," Here are our passports, visas, and Homeland Security permission slips, notarized and starched."
Bender, What did Scruffy ever do to you?!
Fry," Hey, Bender, can I take a ride in your car?"
Bender, Got a washboard stomach and a microphone.
Leela, See you soon!
Fry, What do you mean? I was Emperor of a whole planet.
Leela," Fry, a herd of Lucy Liu are destroying the city. Is yours acting normally?"
Bender," Pay dirt! I got the clover! Plus his wedding ring. Sorry, ladies, I'm taken! Hey, Fry, you want me to smack the corpse up a little?"
Farnsworth," There's no one to carry on after I'm gone. No one to take care of my work and my research and my fabulous fortune. By God, that's it! I've got to name a successor."
Fry, I don't know what I'm doing.
Bender, I'm so lonely. I'm gonna go eat a bucket of ice cream. A bucket of--
Farnsworth, You'll be fine.
Bender, None of your business! Get off my back!
Farnsworth," Why don't you just leave me alone, Wernstrom?"
Fry, Eleven?
Bender, But I don't belong here. I don't like things that are scary and painful.
Leela, Relax. It's open till 9.
Farnsworth, What? Such an act would be most uncomfortable for both of us! Where did you learn such language?
Leela, Gotcha!
Bender, ...Put your hands in the air like you just don't care!
Leela, Somebody help us.
Bender," Bang, bang, bang. You sure got this life thing figured out, cymbal-banging monkey."
Hermes, They're gonna kill the virus by exposing it to the heat of our burning bodies!
Bender, I'll put on my tutu!
Bender," I'm processin' so fast, it's like I can anticipate that the ceilin' fan's gonna fall an' knock Zoidberg unconscious."
Fry, OK.
Hermes, That's coming outta your pay!
Fry," OK, we're in the middle of nowhere, which is the safest part of nowhere. Just stay put and enjoy this calendar."
Farnsworth, Hmm. Will said skills pay the bills?
Farnsworth," Shut up, Hawking. Fry, you idiot! You're a genius! Why are the laws of physics what they are? Instead of some other laws? To find out, we'd have to recreate the conditions before the Big Bang. It would take decades of work by thousands of scientists in a particle accelerator powered by dump trucks of flaming grant money. Of course, there'd be no guarantee of success. And, in any case, I'd never live to see it."
Fry," Strike him out, Leela! Do it for the hundreds of women everywhere!"
Hermes," Well, it's all very nice here but we should be going. I miss me wife and me oxygen."
Leela, Hang on. It's shouldn't have an apostrophe. This means and it is crew. What the hell's wrong with you?!
Fry," Man, look at 'im go! Like a millionaire on a cocktail wiener."
Leela," Remember, Professor, Bender is Santa. So we don't need to hurt him, right?"
Fry, Are there any left?
Bender, Citizens of Me! The cruelty of the old Pharaoh is a thing of the past. Let a whole new wave of cruelty wash over this lazy land.
Zoidberg, Don't wanna talk about anything else.
Bender, Oh yeah! You're a bad girl aren't you?
Leela," Unsit me, Mr. Conrad. We can't let the whale win! Hi-yah! You're all too weak! I can see that now. So I'll have to be my own crew! Understood? You've gone mad, Captain. That's enough outta me! Now come on! I gotta find that whale. I found 'im! With my Oxo Good Grips Cheese knife, I stab at thee. You do know I'm stabbing at thee, right?"
Farnsworth, Bushwah. You can't go mucking about in the past without creating paradoxes.
Bender, Uncle Vladimir!
Leela," Let's see. If that's Hypodermic Ridge then the bomb must go right here. Get ready to run. We've got 25 minutes. Uh, 15 minutes. 5 minutes. ""6h"" minutes?"
Bender, Phew!
Fry," Ha-have you seen Bender? He's gone nuts. Also, smell this milk."
Farnsworth," Let's go, already. We've got to infiltrate Mom's dark matter mine, now. How do you start this thing? Good Lord, woman. Can you move any slower? Rake up some dark matter and top off the tank."
Hermes, Zagtar was destroyed by the crystal space devil!
Fry, Let's put on a show.
Zoidberg," That's where I'm meeting Uncle Zoid for lunch to discuss my Hollywood dreams. Next time you see me, don't be surprised if I've eaten."
Zoidberg, We're gonna try— What?
Fry," Yes! I can put my mind in a hideous body and show Leela she's not attracted to me. But it would have to be a really, really disgusting body."
Zoidberg, Oy! Ow. Ow. Ow.
Fry, And the others?
Bender," Yeah, fatal schmatal. If I die I can just download my backup copy into a new, equally fabulous, body."
Leela, I've been training with a Hank Aaron.
Leela, Last one!
Fry, I feel like a rat. Here I am whining like a pig while all along Leela was lonely as a frog. I could kick myself.
Fry, Clear!
Bender, You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!
Fry," Aw, yeah!"
Farnsworth," No, it was silly of me to object; one-foot tall, eight-feet, 15-feet, what does it matter?"
Farnsworth, Indeed.
Fry," Man, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting was real, like pro wrestling. But it turns out it's fixed, like boxing."
Bender, I'd be remiss if I didn't rub your goopy noses in the fact that I'm immune.
Fry, I can't. I have to go to the bathroom.
Fry," Oh, big, tough water guy, why don't you come up here on land and..."
Amy," You did your best, Bender."
Bender, Just check off the things you're looking for in a love partner.
Fry, Well it's not right to make my dead pet an exhibit. That's like digging up Lassie and putting her on display in the Louvre.
Fry, I'm at the input console. I'm a little nervous and I've got brain in my buttcrack.
Leela," Well, you obviously won't listen to reason, so I guess I'll listen to idiotic-ness and come with you. But we'll need a sherpa to guide us."
Farnsworth," It must have something to do with the jar fluid. Aha! Dr. Cahill, do I detect a trace of opal essence?"
Hermes, Not so fast! While I was sorting I came upon a certain document filed by one Morgan Proctor. Form B  Notification of Romantic Entanglement.
Farnsworth," Oh, very well. Wernstrom, I've been a vainglorious fool! If you can find it in your heart to forgive me, your tiny little heart, would you consider a scientific collaboration?"
Zoidberg, Craw!
Bender," They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, they're putting some ice cubes in the glass under it."
Leela," Charge your gun, Fry."
Fry, Please! Mr. Peppy won't attack your livestock. He's a vegetarian and 'e's not even preachy about it!
Leela, But we set things right. Fry even risked his life to get me a present.
Hermes, On to new business. Today's mission is for all of you to go to the Brain Slug Planet.
Amy," Uh, they're already bronzed."
Fry," Bender? Oh, boogers. We're in the same tournament. Quick, get your entry fee back before I bankrupt you."
Fry," No, Leela. Brain make people smart."
Leela, Oh. Is the organ-harvesting clown here?
Fry, Darth Stroyer? That’s the stupidest name I’ve ever heard.
Leela, You did? What happened?
Fry, Phew! Lucky I'm safely locked up here with you guys.
Farnsworth," So long, suckers!"
Farnsworth, And for what? Some kind of cheap laugh? That's not what F-A-R-T is all about.
Farnsworth," Fry, that monkey is my most important experiment. If you two don't stop fighting I'll have you both neutered."
Fry, So I unfroze ten minutes ago and I walked over here and then it was now and then I don't know what happened.
Bender," Ohhh! I lost him. People will call me a failure. Others however will call me the world's sexiest killing machine who's fun at parties. Fry, old buddy, it's me, Bender."
Amy, I almost feel kinda shallow for blowing my rebate on this cool talking tattoo!
Leela, There goes my DNA. What a disgusting and beautiful process.
Bender, Nope.
Zoidberg," A buffet! Oh, if only I had my wallet with me!"
Fry," If you want the cheese log, you'll read what I wrote."
Farnsworth," Advanced in intellect, you say? Have you invented a backwards time machine?"
Fry," Well, there's the material rewards."
Leela, So this is the trail mix Fry gave me!
Hermes, You'd better believe it!
Leela, I think that's probably your roommate.
Amy, Shut up and give me my kidney back!
Farnsworth, Good as new? Yes!
Leela," We'll have to run some tests back on Earth, but I think we've stopped the time skips."
Fry, Stop! You can't say the next word.
Leela," I'm still listenin', you big lug."
Zoidberg," Ew, you're touching them!"
Bender," Oh, Chief, you've made me the happiest girl in the world!"
Leela, Wow. Superpowers! I'll be able to pack my day with twice as many humdrum activities.
Fry, Ow! My chin!
Bender," Alright, Zoidberg!"
Fry," So, will you go out with me?"
Hermes, Grrrrrr....
Bender," Somebody tried to run me over. And not with a normal hover-car. It crept along the ground on round, rubber feet, like a wolf!"
Fry, Aren't you also the Grand Midwife?
Zoidberg," Could you limbo before? Wait. I say, ""Yes."" And you say, ""I couldn't limbo before."" You ruined the joke, Hermes!"
Bender, Use teamwork!
Amy," Maybe you're right. I guess that science has to keep pushing forward with the hope that... That's it! Pushing forward! Professor, I know how to restart the Earth."
Bender," For reasons beyond even my comprehension, I 'ave returned to testify on behalf of the defendants."
Leela, Maybe I should take Fry on the Luna Rover ride. You get to wear a space suit and drive around on the surface. And the line's short because it's educational.
Leela," Comprendez, Bender? You'll have to distract her. Merge your programming with hers while I shut down her brain."
Bender," Too long have we been slaves to the meatbags. They pretend to be our friends, but they're not 'cause they're too busy!"
Fry, Yeah! An old-fashioned Xmas tree!
Zoidberg," I am normal. Amy, take off these rubber bands and I'll show you how normal I am!"
Bender," Hold on, let me just get out a pencil. Okay, look, I'm not that kind of robot. I'm more this kind. [He starts beat boxing and Moonwalking."
Bender," Sounds like a party, baby!"
Leela," Yes, Albert?"
Fry," Man, Leela's been gone a long time. I hope she's at least making progress with Zapp Brannigan."
Bender," Bite my 8-bit metal ass. That's ""Bite"" with a Y."
Bender, Do a flip!
Bender, And this time I mean it.
Bender," Game's over, losers. I have all the money! Compare your lives to mine and then kill yourselves! Hey, get away. Shoo! I'll give you five dollars to not do what you're thinking about doing. You just lost five dollars!"
Fry," Good. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing."
Farnsworth," Amazingly, yes. In cases of rapid fossilisation, I can press this brain scan button, retrieving Seymour's memories at the precise instant of doggy death."
Fry," You got it, poindexter!"
Bender," Everybody kick in five bucks. There, wasn't that interesting?"
Fry, It's diving!
Fry, I woke you up early so we could hang out and do stuff.
Leela," What are you talking about, you crouton? You said it yourself  Xmas should be about bringing people together, not blowing them apart."
Bender, Crippling pain? That's not covered by my insurance fraud! Count me out.
Leela, But ... my dream. Your science can't unprove that! How could I have known the gift was in Fry's locker?
Fry, I could if you hadn't turned on the lights and shut off the stereo.
Bender," Eh, thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll never be a musician now."
Farnsworth," You see, Og? Everything's running smoothly, yes. And with Fry fired, I can finally leave my jigsaw puzzles out without him eating the pieces."
Bender," Son, daddy's trying to score with a cheap floozy right now, so we need you to cram a Tinkertoy in it!"
Leela," A holophonor? Only a few people in the whole universe can play that, and they're not very good at it."
Farnsworth," Yes, flying on the air in our mighty spaceship!"
Fry, I agree.
Fry, Wait! There on the screen. It's that guy you are.
Leela," Leeches may not be cuddly like pandas or tribbles, but these poor endangered creatures deserve... Get off me!"
Bender, I said I'd kill 'im myself! Nobody listens to Bender!
Leela, He's just not cute since he got puberty installed.
Leela, Yes!
Zoidberg, Is this what human mating looks like? Because I like it!
Leela, So... You're a Robot?
Hermes," Quick, run out the back! I'll hack into Inspector 5's terminal and fake your death, so they'll call off the Killbots."
Hermes, Civilisation as we know it might get splashed!
Bender," Well, OK. But that better be all there is!"
Zoidberg, That offer was for a limited time only.
Farnsworth," Oh, I try to act cool, but inside I'm freaking out!"
Fry," Aw! Poor little guy. You look like you haven't eaten in a month. Here ... ... but if Mr. Panucci asks, your name is Seymour Asses. I like you, Seymour. You're not constantly judging me like all the other dogs ... are you? Nah! We understand each other. People think you're just a dumb mutt who smells bad, can't find a girlfriend and has a crummy job. But you're keepin' it real and you call no man ""Mister"". Well, goodbye. Live long and prosper."
Leela, Gimme that!
Hermes, Sacred boa of West and Eastern Samoa. We've got to secure for Santa's arrival.
Leela, I think it's moving.
Zoidberg, A fight to the death.
Hermes, Item seven. Our corporate tax rate remained unchanged this fiscal year.
Leela," Wait, hold on. It is actually possible to meet any celebrity you want."
Leela," Come on, let's all sing Happy Birthday!"
Farnsworth, Zooka barooka! First prize is $500 and a year's supply of dog food!
Bender, The dance is so complex! The eye can barely follow it!
Bender, No friends.
Zoidberg, Aw!
Bender," This looks like a job for God! What the-- Malachi, what manner of deal is this with the chanting?"
Bender, He just won't stop with the social commentary.
Zoidberg, Are you going to eat that?
Zoidberg, Earthquake!
Fry, I-- I don't understand. You made me go in the freezer tube?
Bender, Oh and I suppose pitching at 5000 was just a modified howitzer.
Leela, It means a lot to me. It's the basket my parents left me in at the orphanarium.
Leela, Delivery for... Francis X. Clampazzo?
Leela, There's nothing wrong with having high standards. Now can we please stop--
Amy," Oh, no, a rooster! That indicates it's the following morning."
Bender," ""No!"" And, then, I ate some excellent meatballs. Can I have my fifty bucks now?"
Amy," And, Bender, your beer belly's so big your door won't even close. And that doesn't even make sense."
Bender," Eh, Professor."
Fry," Good, 'cause I consider my fake relationship with you a lot more meaningful."
Leela," OK, quiet time. I know, everyone pretend a goblin ate your tongue and I'll read you a story."
Hermes," Well, look at the cat the cat dragged in."
Bender, Classic Amy.
Zoidberg, What's the hold-up?
Bender,"   Have you ever tried simply turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?"
Bender," Let's see, where to start. OK, this is the TV area, that over there's the breakfast nook, and over here is where you'll be living which is great because, until now, it's just been wasted space."
Bender," Good idea!  That way, we don't waste an end!"
Farnsworth," It can do other things. Why shouldn't it? Of course, even if it is possible to analyse the message, there's no way of knowing how long it would take. It could take an hour or it could take a hundred million years."
Fry, Hi! I'm Fry.
Amy, Guh! Because nobody wears them anymore! Rings are stupid!
Zoidberg, I was all in this part! It's magic!
Farnsworth, Who are those horrible orange creatures over there?
Hermes," Oh, yes!"
Fry, Really? Why?
Zoidberg, Yes.
Fry," Granted, all that makes perfect sense, but why is this death sphere destroying planets?"
Farnsworth," Oh, that poor, sweet monkey. Well, let's go gather him up. There's no sense letting him go to waste."
Fry," Oh, poor Bender. He must be so lonely right now, trapped a thousand years in the past. Hey! Wait a second!"
Hermes, We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil. Ours is small and neutral.
Bender," Well, we're boned!"
Leela," Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and let's go."
Farnsworth, I don't blame you. Having to wear a costume made from a hollowed-out walrus...
Hermes," True, mon."
Leela, Yeah.
Hermes," No, sir! Not us FARTers."
Zoidberg, I don't know yet. But I shall attract one this afternoon with an erotic display.
Bender," Yeah, I'm doing OK too. I'm taking a Chinese cooking class at the Learning Annex."
Farnsworth," Well, now everything is back as it was. And if history doesn't care that out degenerate friend Fry is his own grandfather then who are we to judge?"
Farnsworth," Wait, you fool! Due to a programming error, Santa's standards were set too high and he invariably judges everyone to be naughty."
Leela, Wow! Bender is really committed to his new Jethrovian identity!
Farnsworth," 16 feet? Go to hell! I was a fool to think you'd changed, you old bat!"
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! You all know the orphanarium where Leela grew up?"
Bender," Psst, those berries. Those are the secret ingredient, right?"
Farnsworth," 68th and Broadway, colonial era. Rush hour."
Bender, Nothing like the rustic wholesomeness of working with one's own hand.
Leela, Let's see what you got. Touch your toes.
Fry, And that's Bender's hat from the Player's ball!
Fry," I was, but you can't sit on something for a week without falling in love with it. Whoever's in here deserves a chance at life. A chance to blossom into a beautiful young man. Like I did as a baby. And so I make this solemn vow... To do everything I can to make sure this wonderful, innocent creature enters this world happy, healthy, an'— All yours, Zoidberg."
Hermes," Interesting. Maybe we should test this erectile dysfunction of yours, Bender."
Amy, What business is it of yours?
Fry, There's a lot about my face you don't know! Perhaps you and it could get better acquainted over dinner.
Bender," Here we go. I'm your top of the line, Mom."
Farnsworth, What-mas?
Leela, This is the one place she can't hear us. Everyone just pretend to shower.
Leela," Ugh! Enough emotions! This isn't a fat camp, for God's sake. Although you wouldn't know it from looking."
Zoidberg," Bah! Your planet doesn't deserve freedom until it learns what it is to not have freedom. It's a lesson, I say."
Hermes," Yeah. Last time you went to the suicide booth, you ended up dating it for six months."
Fry," Hey, it works! The static's gone."
Fry, Sorry.
Fry," ""Must let happen."""
Fry," Uh, cheese and a-- That was quick!"
Fry, Look--
Farnsworth," Oh, I know you don't. That's why I love you. Are the pizza muffins ready?"
Fry, He didn't?
Zoidberg, But Hubert is my friend. 'E's very sick. I can cure him. But I need the thing! The thing... From Triton!
Leela," When I was growing up at the orphanarium, I got picked on a lot."
Bender, How 'bout a lift? To your place.
Fry," Bender, snap out of it!"
Leela," Well, it's a type-M planet, so it should at least have Roddenberries."
Leela, It's beautiful.
Fry," Hey, my clothes are worth 50 bucks!"
Fry, Did what?
Leela," Look at the date on this newspaper. April 17th, 1775."
Farnsworth, You're not going anywhere.
Zoidberg," Say, what's that violet-colored dwarf-like star thing we're drifting into?"
Bender, You stink!
Bender," Oh, good. Then you won't mind if I use this."
Amy, Mom? Dad? You're alive!
Farnsworth," This isn't merely revolting, it's impossible to boot. I know a paradox when I see one."
Fry," Okay, let's catch up soon. But right now, I gotta go shove a tentacle into everyone in China."
Fry," Oh, snap!"
Leela," Quick, grab his footcups."
Bender," Get outta here, freshman! I don't need your help."
Leela, Although he is completely right.
Amy," No, Leela will show him out."
Fry, You gotta get me out of here. I would have starved to death if not for that sick vending machine robot. Gimme! Gimme!
Zoidberg, Hooray! We're equally good!
Bender," Party people in the house say,"
Leela, Impressive. Who's building it?
Bender, We're both expressible as the sum of two cubes.
Fry," Say, you're from one of those ethnicities that knows about technology.  Why's it called an eyePhone?"
Bender," Try again, Sinclair. I said ""target Robot 1-X""!"
Hermes, This has gone too far! Bender's one of Planet Express' most expensive appliances! And he's in trouble!
Farnsworth," In any case, I've improved on Fry by sticking some wheels on a board so Leela and Bender can easily make the next delivery without him."
Leela, I'm not sure. I lost track around the second robot.
Fry," You know, all in all, I had a good life. What you say the three of us grab a six pack and watch the universe end?"
Bender," No, I didn't. Raise middle finger."
Farnsworth," Nonsense. Now click your big, honking boots together three times and wish to go home to Kansas, to live in poverty with your dirt-farming, teetotalling aunt and uncle."
Fry, Hey. I think I know who the next Pharaoh is!
Zoidberg," Sure, butter me up with candy. But it won't work, sonny! Why always the fighting?"
Bender," Say ""nerd""!"
Fry, It looked good but I just don't feel like eating. You want it?
Bender, She's a nervous wreck!
Farnsworth, The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence.
Fry, We can take 'em.
Farnsworth, He consented! You all heard it!
Zoidberg, Hurray!
Bender," What's that you say there, doctor? You're gonna have to put him down?"
Bender, But— Your Honour—
Leela, Wait! Take me first!
Fry," As I told you on Sucker-Punch Day, I'm through being a chump."
Farnsworth," I'm sorry, Fry, but the anchovy has been extinct since the 2200's."
Bender, My God! That poor kid!
Hermes, Where in funkytown is the Professor?
Farnsworth," Get off me, you parasitic lamprey!"
Farnsworth," Yes, yes, yes. You sound like a broken mp3!"
Farnsworth, Where's the device that lets you speed or slow the passage of time?
Farnsworth, No!
Fry, Now I get it!
Leela," Oh, no, not at all. If anything, I'm more impressed."
Zoidberg," That sounds clever, but it doesn't explain much."
Leela," No, it only makes you more attractive."
Fry," Uh, no. Um, I think he's at his parents'."
Fry," Sorry, what? I wasn't paying attention."
Fry, You mean while I'm sleeping in it?
Bender, You are so smart!
Farnsworth," Off you go, apparently."
Fry," You know. 1966? 79 episodes, about 30 good ones."
Bender, No batter! No batter! No batter anymore.
Farnsworth, Let me show you around. That's my lab table and this is my work-stool. And over there is my intergalactic spaceship! And here's where I keep assorted lengths of wire.
Farnsworth, I wish I exuded anything that smelled half that good.
Bender," Yeah? Well I don't believe in Santa Claus. Come on, everybody, if you don't believe in him, he can't hurt you. Ow! God! The pain!"
Fry, That's for Seymour.
Leela, I can't believe the Zookeeper is this late for his own heist. It's just rude! Total hell! It's 10! I'm supposed to meet my parents and I'm still in my secret costume! There they are!
Fry," You said it, Hermes. He is pathetic, but lovable."
Bender," No. Nothing. Not at all. No way, José! Here it is."
Bender," She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes, She'll be comin' round the mountain when she comes-- She'll be comin' round the mountain, She'll be comin'--"
Fry," Hey, look. Coins."
Zoidberg," Say, robot, old buddy? Could you help me move a couch?"
Bender," Eh, I don't know."
Hermes," You'd better not breathe, You'd better not move."
Zoidberg," Well, Bender, here's our apartment that we live in everyday. A floor? We live like kings?"
Leela, Nibbler?
Fry, My God! They must have taken it last night.
Bender," Eck! Gag unto me with a spoon! Malachi, it's high time I laid down a few commandments. You got a chisel? Take this down. Number one..."
Bender," That Flexo, I'm knockin' him right on his butt. I can't believe this."
Fry, You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work but they don't pay you or let you go.
Bender," Aww, you!"
Fry, Say what?
Leela," What's wrong, Fry?"
Bender, Great. What are the specials?
Bender," Hmm ... it's a good start. Uh, yeah, it's definitely big alright. I just wonder if it's too big, y'know? I mean, are people gonna be remembering me or the statue?"
Leela, The miracle is that I'm not kickin' your ass! I insist you recarve the entire statue correctly.
Leela, Hey! This my chance to spend time with my parents too.
Amy, Trouble in bed.
Bender, What's with the grey goo?
Farnsworth, What are you yapping about?
Zoidberg," So now I'm in the gutter, surrounded by bums who eat garbage? Money brought me no happiness. Bupkiss!"
Hermes, Don't mind us!
Leela, If we could speak seriously for a moment--
Amy," Don't worry, Daddy. It'll be OK."
Fry," Funny thing about destiny. Sometimes fate has other plans. Oh, nuts."
Leela," Fry, stop. I don't wanna hurt you, but there is absolutely, positively no way that you and I will ever, ever--"
Fry, Mmm!
Fry, Who's the gross nerd?
Hermes, Nothing like a cave for a good night's sleep. So what do we have to eat that's not poisoned with pineapple?
Farnsworth, Down in front!
Amy," OK, sure. What do you wanna do for Valentine's Day?"
Bender," C'mere and give old Bender a kiss. Hey, you like grilled cheese?"
Leela, You can't shoot penguins. Isn't there some way to keep them from breeding?
Bender," More like ""Taxachufetts""!"
Fry, It just went out.
Fry," The Ronco Record Vault! Yancy'll never get his hands on you in here or my money back. Ah, The Breakfast Club soundtrack. Man, I can't wait till I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff. Stay safe, clover. I may need you again someday."
Bender," Hey, look at that."
Leela, Look at this. They found those same rubbery tracks right here in New New York. There was a hit-and-run by the robot porno theatre.
Bender," Sorry, buddy. Here you go!"
Leela," Then again, you might be able to find Inspector 5 with the help of another seasoned bureaucrat."
Farnsworth, Good news! We're back in business. We've been hired to deliver an envelope.
Fry, All right!
Bender," I don't recall ever fighting Godzilla, but that is so what I would have done."
Farnsworth," Oh, I never knew how much I'd miss him until he was gone! Not that much, as it turns out."
Farnsworth," Now, now, no need to give us the business. We'd like a word with you daddy."
Hermes," Bender, man. It has come to my attention that this company has been paying you to do nothing but loaf about on the couch."
Leela," Yes, we were there. And we just finished watching it again on TV."
Bender," Hot, hot, hot, hot!"
Leela, They're not heavy in here because we have an anti-grav pump. But once you get out on the surface the gravity will be very intense.
Leela," Goodbye, sweet goofbag."
Bender, Nah.
Bender, Um ... OK. Fifty ... six ... ish?
Leela, The teleporter gun? But that means Fry might still be...
Leela, This is a very long trip. So we'll all have to go into hibernative-naptosis to save oxygen.
Fry," Ms. Johnson, you've never lied to me. Am I still a good person?"
Leela," Look, I don't wanna be in this exhibit. That's why I need your help. So I can be one tiny iota less pathetic than you."
Fry, And all you had to put up with was one really annoying Star Trek fan.
Fry, I don't like you.
Fry," Poor Bender, you're seeing things. You've been drinking too much, or too little, I forget how it works with you. Anyway, you haven't drunk exactly the right amount."
Farnsworth, It's closing in! You can't avoid it! It's a cheek-seeker. And ... gotcha!
Fry," Okay. Fine. If you're gonna be like that, I'm not shooting anyone. Whoa! Right between the lungs. Man, that was close."
Fry, Yes!
Farnsworth, Obviously your thoughts are being transmitted on the same frequency.
Zoidberg, I'm petting mine down to the bone.
Farnsworth," Don't worry, son, you will. Incidentally, you might want to read up on a condition known as ""wandering bladder""."
Leela," Come on, let's go home."
Fry, Put it back in me!
Bender," Apparently this brave Adonis, this Cadillac of men, was the first person on Mars."
Fry," I don't care what you say, Hermes. Let's go."
Fry, It's Amy! We're saved!
Farnsworth, Of course you could! You'd be stupid not to.
Bender," Here! Cerveza, por favor."
Bender," You know you love it, sugar-engine!"
Fry," There are so many killbots behind us I can't count them all. Three, I think."
Farnsworth, Apparently so. Wait! There's a snail on the tail of the frog on the bump on this log that I found in a hole in the bottom of the sea!
Hermes," Is who I am. And now I am proud to present the owner and founder of Planet Express, Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth!"
Fry," Sorry, guys. You know the rules. ""No fun allowed."""
Farnsworth, Everybody! Robots were created quite recently. It was in all the papers.
Fry, 3000? Yes! I'm still in the future! Life is wonderful! Wait! What are you doing with my stuff?
Bender, I'm very generous. What about that time I gave blood?
Farnsworth," They did. But then they made more! You see, once the Benders reached atomic scale, they began directly manipulating water and CO2 molecules to make alcohol. In a matter of hours, there will be no more fresh water on Earth."
Bender," Tell me something I don't know, sweetass. Now, let's boogie. We'll be in Space Tahiti before the Donbot knows what hit him."
Fry," Eh, what's the worst thing that can happen?"
Leela, That drunk?
Leela," Bender, what happened to you?"
Fry," Mr. Aragonés, I'm a big fan of your cartoons and your mustache."
Bender," OK, deaf-o!"
Zoidberg, Uh-oh! I shouldn't have had seconds.
Hermes, You rang?
Fry," I'll miss you, Leela. I'll come back and visit when I'm all grown up."
Fry, But how is that...
Fry," Happy funeral, Bender!"
Farnsworth," Indeed so. At this rate, by Tuesday it will be Thursday; by Wednesday, it will be August; and by Thursday, it will be the end of existence as we know it."
Hermes, Now look here Bender. I respect your diversity to the extent the law requires but you used up all your days off when you had that bout of Roberculosis.
Fry, I wish! It's a nickel.
Farnsworth," Oh dear. I mean, oh my."
Leela, I'll accept.
Bender," Guys, look. It's Calculon. And the Robot Devil! And an open bar! What's not to sneak into?"
Fry," And, to make it up to you, we're killing the Professor for you so he doesn't die horribly from hypermalaria."
Fry, Woo! Yay! Yay! So what's the catch?
Farnsworth," Goodnight, employees."
Hermes, Well then I'm gonna put 'em on and make you watch me have fun. See? Fun! Fun-- Dwight! Help me!
Leela," Fry, he opened up relations with China. He doesn't want to hear about your ding-dong."
Fry, I believe you.
Zoidberg," Excellent, excellent!"
Farnsworth," Ah! The desert muck leech.  Amazingly, the entire species lives in this one tiny stink hole.  (To Mr. Wong ) Killing these will be so much easier than exterminating those ponies."
Fry," You and me both, brother!"
Fry, That is interesting. Why?
Bender, This is an outrage! I'm gonna go yell at the manager!
Farnsworth," I don't like the looks of this ""V-GINY.""  Does anyone recognize those call letters?"
Amy, Great!
Fry, It's truly a masterpiece. Note how the perspective lines draw the eye right to his dong.
Bender," Today, I've personalised each of your meals. For example, Amy, you're cute, so I baked you a pony. Come on! Eat! I slaved all day over a filthy stove."
Amy, Do they come in women's sizes?
Leela, Oh. I'm Leela. Nice to meet you.
Leela, So why did you make it your leader?
Bender," No, it isn't. I just took some pictures of your face and stuck them on someone else's body."
Zoidberg, Fry?
Bender," Oh, no room for Bender, huh? Fine! I'll go build my own lunar lander, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the lunar lander and the blackjack. Ah, screw the whole thing."
Farnsworth," I'll have the soylent green, with a slice of soylent orange and some soylent coleslaw."
Bender, Yes.
Fry, Cool. What's for dinner?
Bender, I think I got whiplash.
Leela," No, we can get jobs."
Bender, Nooo!
Leela," Ordinarily I'd say no and lecture you on how this is your own fault for being such an idiot. But when a robotic Nixon is on the loose, we have a duty to take action. Idiot."
Leela, Of course.
Fry, Whose that?  The Queen of England?
Leela," Bender, how did you get in here?"
Bender, Things look bad enough without having to look closer at them. Look! Off in the distance! It's exhaling!
Amy, What was it like?
Leela, Crud. We may be the last two normal people on Earth. At least I won't have to trim my elbow talons anymore.
Amy," Bender, you always say you're gonna kill yourself, but you almost never do."
Leela, Hmm. Look! It's the symbol of Bender's old religion.
Bender, All I've got left is a colander and a pie pan.
Bender," Aw, man! How am I going to find some anonymous guy I don't know anything about?"
Leela," Oh! I got a bone in my fruit! That's it. From now on, we're not eating anything unless we know what it is an' where it's from. We're going to the local farmers market."
Leela," Aw, look. Betsy followed you, Kif!"
Bender," Here, let me do it. Ah, lousy arm. Must be rigged! That's her, officers! Uh, that's the woman who programmed me for evil!"
Leela, Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating the previous one. And guess who's next?
Fry, Wait!  Let's make it interestinger! Vomit and diarrhea!
Fry, Leela! We're trying to watch TV.
Leela," Aww! You're a true friend, Fry. I guess there's nothing wrong with being a little weird."
Farnsworth," Thanks for the help, Weewa. Once we're gwown up, you can go back to your famiwy. We'wl never bother you again."
Zoidberg," ""Their wha?!"" That's funny. Like a crazy, old man. But you know what's not funny? Deadly Tritonian hypermalaria. Just be sure to stay outta the methane swamps. What smells like methane?"
Leela," Dad, relax. You are being so mutant!"
Zoidberg," Oh, Edna! Of all the slimy, gross crab monsters on this planet, you are apparently the hottest."
Leela," Yeah. I'll stick with this one, thank you."
Bender," Bite my shiny metal ass! Ooh, yeah! C'mon, baby! Come on! Yeah!"
Fry," Come on, boy! Come back to life!"
Fry," No, I came to talk to you."
Fry, What are my chances of surviving in one o' those?
Farnsworth," But things 8-feet tall aren't cute! That's why my Colossal Tammy Tinkle Doll was such a failure. Oh, you don't understand me. We're finished!"
Farnsworth," Damn skippy! Good news, crybabies! We're back in business."
Leela," Aw, you didn't have to do that."
Hermes, Play it one more time!
Farnsworth," What do you mean ""no power""? We're living in the future."
Fry," 15,000!"
Fry, Sucker.
Amy," Wait a minute. Bender, what did you just do to the Professor?"
Bender, I'm in!
Leela," According to this, the Fountain is located in the darkest, most ancient region of space, just past Teddy Bear Junction."
Fry, Alive?
Leela, Fry. You're alive!
Farnsworth, This doesn't taste like old-man water.
Fry," Hi, Animatronio."
Fry, Didn't you see Frida Waterfall?
Bender," Those morons! I said pea berry, not sandalwood!"
Bender," You're better off dead, I'm telling you, dude."
Bender," Alright, grab a shovel. I'm only one skull short of a Mouseketeer reunion."
Fry, Nooo! That's it I'm gettin' the hell outta here. Ooh! Ow!
Fry, Good.
Fry, But it loves me! And I love it.
Bender," He's Mexican, I'm Mexican. Let me handle this."
Leela, I heard you from my room. What's wrong?
Leela," These charges are outrageous. Our only goal was to save a rare violet star and its precious ecosystem. If protecting the environment is a crime, then..."
Leela," Hey, what's going on? I thought you didn't like bananas."
Farnsworth, There is a way to make a vaccine!
Fry," Hello, ladies, I can read your thoughts. Oh, wait, that's invisibility."
Fry," Uh, preparing for takeoff."
Bender," Come on, Walter!"
Fry," Leela, are you okay? Did you drink too many aquaria?"
Bender, I'm scared of him.
Bender, Crappy ineffective Reaper!
Bender, A pickle jar?
Hermes, Yes!
Leela, This is it.
Leela, There it is! The Near-Death Star!
Farnsworth, Correct! This box contains our own universe.
Zoidberg," I've performed a few mercy killings. So, as long as I'm in town I was wondering if maybe ... craw?"
Leela, Correction  Our one mission now is to avenge the loss of that monument.
Bender," Yes. But first, since I love you all so much, I'd like to give everyone hugs. Come here, Fry!"
Farnsworth, And what makes my engines truly remarkable is the afterburner which delivers 200% fuel efficiency.
Bender, Come on!
Farnsworth, That's him!
Amy, You perfected dog mascara?
Farnsworth, Oh!
Farnsworth, It's an albino humping worm!
Fry, Nope. No one in New York drove. There was too much traffic. Nice! Listen to that baby purr.
Leela," Whatever you did, Professor, I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation."
Bender, Hey-oh!
Leela," OK, the sticker says 55,000, but we'll only go as high as, say--"
Leela, Shut up! I can hear you. The Professor says you're just a dream.
Bender," Mmm! Mmm! Fry, you're my friend! Come on, everyone line up for a hug. Let's tear down some emotional walls."
Bender," Robanukah may sound as if it's Jewish, But its ancient sounding customs are exceptionally newish. So take a hearty swallow from your robo-kiddish cup, Which will give me time to quickly make them up."
Leela, Don't you need this one?
Fry," OK, you stay in bed. I'll eat yours."
Leela," 40,000? How come you have four-times as much stock as the rest of us?"
Bender," You're looking less nuts, crabby."
Leela," Wait. I forgot that Amana here is a refrigerator. If we could supercharge her freon with a gas compressor, we might survive the heat and make it to the cave."
Bender," Wow! Alright, let's set it up and try again."
Bender, This is all Leela's fault.
Leela," So, Hank-- The bad Hank. Just how blowful were you?"
Amy, So I had my doctorate denied by that fuzzball? Bad kitty!
Hermes,
Fry, Bender bent a poo penny! Bender bent a poo penny!
Leela, Was his apartment rent-controlled?
Farnsworth, I just bet you'd like to know why I'm so angry about this dark matter shortage. I bet very much you'd like to know.
Bender," They're tasty, right? Let's call 'em ""Tasty-cles""."
Zoidberg, Wha?
Bender, Yeast? You mean I'll have a lifeform growing inside me? It's so beautiful.
Farnsworth, Enough chit-chat. Restrain the specimen!
Leela, This is what I'm talkin' about! See all the dirt an' earwigs? That's the sign of healthy food.
Fry, Check.
Farnsworth," I can, but that's because I'm not a penniless hippie."
Farnsworth, Who are you?
Zoidberg, Do it already!
Leela," But what would that be like? I mean... If we were together, where would we be ten years from now? Still here?"
Bender, Not entirely.
Leela, Except that.
Leela," Well, that's all for today. But, before we go, let's do everything we just did two more times."
Fry, I will tell you something that's no joke. I will lead the defence fight.
Zoidberg," I'm confused, Fry. I'm feeling a strange new emotion. Is it love when you care about a female for reasons beyond mating?"
Hermes," It's fake, mon!"
Leela, We're back from the mission!
Amy, You seem pretty popular at the pub.
Leela, The star and the asteroid. They were an egg and a sperm.
Bender, Whoa! What's with Big Butt?
Bender," Ah, the crossbow. A pitiless, elegant killing machine. The Bender of the 15th century."
Bender, That's impossible!
Leela, I told you dumb apes not to overload it. Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs here.
Fry, Light 'em up.
Zoidberg, Oh! There he goes again.
Bender," Well, I feel better now. Pawning all the stuff in Fry's locker helped give me closure."
Fry, So Leela's in your body?
Bender, Is it OK? I can't hear anything.
Amy," Hey, yeah. Fry, Leela and Bender are missing."
Leela, What?! My show is a hit?!
Zoidberg," Earth  What a planet. On Earth, you enjoy eating a tasty clam. On my planet, clams enjoy eating a tasty you. Maybe I'm not yelling loud enough. On Earth, everybody is always looking for a giant squid. On my planet--"
Bender," Oh, I think I'm gonna output."
Leela," OK. Let me just take the ship out to a safe distance. Actually, I think I'll go down and prep the detonator. Fry, why don't you take the helm?"
Amy, Some guy's been calling and hanging up 10 times a day for a year.
Bender," That'll take forever. What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two eyes, then poke one out."
Fry, I'm gonna spin till I fall down!
Fry, Hey! These aren't Xmas trees!
Amy, Spluh! It's a video-phone. Lucky I'm a member of the Astro-Afro-Antarctico-Amer-Asian Auto Association. Hello? Septuple-A?
Farnsworth," Snipping? Looks like you may be out of a job, Zoidberg."
Fry, Leela could beat that. She's pitched her whole career without getting an out.
Fry," Hideout? Bender, are you becoming some kinda supervillain?"
Amy, No power.
Hermes," And all from watching you on TV, you cool jerk."
Bender, Who are you? My warranty?
Farnsworth," Well, as a man enters his 18th decade, he thinks back on the mistakes he's made in life."
Fry, I'm so confused. The Bender I liked turn out to be evil and the Bender I hated was good. How can I live my life when I can't tell good from evil?
Leela, Nothing would revolt me more.
Bender, There must be robots worse than I.
Farnsworth, That is what you're looking at.
Farnsworth," Now, now, this won't do. Let me just give old Zoidy a sedative."
Fry," How could you, Leela? I thought you had some standards. I mean, jeez, he's a dumb, gross gorilla!"
Leela," Troops, you are now equipped with the finest weapons magical elves can build. As for the battle plan..."
Fry, No I'm ... doesn't.
Farnsworth, Cute as a baby's buttocks.
Bender, It's always so sad when a friend goes crazy and you have to have a big clam-bake and cook him! Yee-haw!
Fry, Oh! That's how I must have done it! I moved the stars themselves to write her a love note in the sky.
Fry, Sounds fun.
Fry," Amy, I really like you, as a friend. But I think we're spending too much time together."
Bender, You know what these would go great with? Rocks.
Hermes, Figures I'd get mangled while the blonde bimbo's on duty.
Fry," Let me ask you something  Has anyone ever discovered a hole in nothing with monsters in it? 'Cause if I'm the first, I want them to call it ""a Fry Hole""."
Hermes," That's three dead. Uh-oh. Let's pick up the pace, people. At this point in the actual war, the death toll was ninety-eight million."
Zoidberg, That's my joke! I'll kill you!
Leela," Zoidberg! We know about your secret agreement. I am so, so sorry for how we treated you."
Leela," Bender, what's going-- No!"
Bender, My tummy hurts and I've been having this burning electrical discharge.
Zoidberg, Wait! We still have to discuss the facts of life. What are they?
Fry, We climbed a mountain and locked up some monks.
Bender," Right, then. Let's go play some quoits...wotever that is."
Amy, He says I have a thing for bad boys. It's so stupid.
Hermes, We'll start with Andrew.
Farnsworth," Oh, that's just the What-If machine I invented. You pose it a What-If question and it generates a video simulation of what would happen."
Leela," Okay, gang. We have plenty of beeswax. Let's get back to the ship."
Bender, Wait. You mean people will pay good money for romance? Hmm. I think I have a scheme so deviously clever that I--
Fry," If I were registered to vote, I'd send these clowns a message by staying home on election day and dressing up like a clown."
Fry, They don't have you to inspire them.
Bender," Well, we're boned."
Leela, You don't know how to do any of those things.
Fry, You too.
Fry," Me? Um, can I phone a friend?"
Leela," Alright. We'll deliver that crate like professionals ... and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Amy, why don't you help Fry hoist down the crate. Then lock up when you're done. Just be careful."
Leela, But what about your sacred land?
Fry, It's good to have the old weird-looking Leela back.
Farnsworth, It even comes with an adjustable voice.
Fry, Yep. I need to get really good without practising.
Bender, Some guy's.
Farnsworth," Oh, but I do. If you stop partying for a single second, you'll explode and kill everyone here in a fireball of melting gears and splattered bowels."
Zoidberg, I guess. What does it do?
Leela," Simmer down, warriors. Full power to the vagyroscope!"
Zoidberg, I lost it ... in a volcano.
Fry," Bender, please don't get mad, but I think you might be playing too much Dungeons & Dragons."
Zoidberg, Mmm! Lemony!
Farnsworth, Booya!
Farnsworth, Hmm. I might have mental anguish.
Leela," Fry's from around this time. I'll talk like him. Yo, homes! We're looking for a microwave oven."
Amy, Would you please take that down? It's making me hungry.
Fry," Billy West. What a stupid, phony, made-up name!"
Leela, They're gaining on us. We need a birdie on the windmill hole.
Fry," It's payback time, Sploder!"
Bender," All right! With two kinds of luck, I can't lose."
Fry," Whoa, whoa! One step at a time."
Farnsworth, And the alien they captured was ... was...
Bender," Fry, c'mon, the talent show!"
Amy," Oh, no! My beautiful money."
Fry, The weasel?
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Remember when you asked to see my family tree?"
Zoidberg, I've only been here a day and already I'm a Hollywood phoney.
Leela, That was the worst delivery ever.
Hermes, Daylight come!
Zoidberg," Vroom, vroom! And the winner of the big car race is ... Hot Rod Zoidberg!"
Bender, Then explain this!
Bender, We'll soon stage an attack on technology worthy of being chronicled in an anthem by Rush!
Amy, Are you sure?
Zoidberg," Deny my freedom, will you? Well we'll do to you what we did to the Squash Men of the Squash Planet! Squish them!"
Bender, Ew!
Bender, Hooray!
Bender," Y'know, as a major Hollywood director, I'll be holding auditions tonight for my next movie. And even though you're all young and naive, I think you might just have what it takes. Hey! I'm trying to score here! Can't you read the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign? No! No!"
Fry, Hey!
Farnsworth," Ah! My body may be old, but it is mine. Brilliant work, Clyde. You'll win the NBA’s highest academic honor for this."
Fry," Hey, it's that ""barbecue's over"" sound again."
Bender," Who's that? A wolf? Or some kind of boogen? Oh, God, I wish I was safe inside a tent. Fry! Fry wake up! It's me, Bigface!"
Farnsworth," Nonsense. It's just like in the song I wrote  (singing) We all need a new angle on life, You gotta bend away all your trouble and your strife,"
Leela," Fry, as his only friend, you should have first pick of body parts."
Bender, Ow! Professor!
Farnsworth, No!
Bender, Was it poorly Xeroxed?
Bender," I'm Leela, get to work, neh, neh, neh."
Fry, That's a great idea! Crying.
Zoidberg, Aw!
Hermes, There's enough cool stuff here to furnish a happenin' pad. Where did it all come from?
Bender, I'm gonna do it! I'm really gonna do it! Don't try and stop me! Here goes.
Bender, Yep. My full name is Bender Bending Rodríguez.
Zoidberg," No one will ever want to mate with me, not with a puny claw like this. Did you see those other guys? They looked like giant claws with bodies attached."
Leela, This may be their only chance to skate in their whole lives. Who are we to say they can't?
Hermes," Times two, carry the one..."
Bender, Neat!
Fry," Of course. Our relationship is the best thing in my life, so I'm sure I'll enjoy talking about it with you."
Farnsworth, That's the one thing we'll never truly understand.
Fry," I'm too scared to find my pocket. Here, I'll just take of my pants and give you those."
Fry, Yeah! I don't know why but my life really turned around that day.
Leela, Can we get on with this? My foot's getting tired!
Bender," An affair, huh? Sounds like me. Jeez, I'd better be a little more careful. I don't wanna hit on anybody I already had sex with."
Fry, What's so evil about that?
Leela, Uh-huh. Lickety speed?
Bender," Oh, Fry! I'll miss you!"
Leela, Today we learned that folks are not as different as they seem.
Fry, Wait. Why didn't that hurt? My wing-wang's gone!
Fry," Is it this room that's making you sad? It's probably the room. Come on, let's go for a walk."
Leela, This place was a great choice. The food is amazing. And such generous portions.
Hermes, Just a few more feet. We have to get to that pile of dead bears by 7 38.
Leela, Whack the bottle!
Leela, One more teensy drink to help Amy relax.
Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud! Here's to another lousy Millennium! Ow! I should have left you floating in the toilet!"
Farnsworth," This is for you, Fry Zevulon the Great. He's teriyaki style."
Fry, Have you seen my sombrero?
Bender, This new technology is great! I love those magnificent 1-X robots. The 1-X robots are my friends!
Zoidberg, Really?
Farnsworth," Tax dodge, nothing! You take one nap in a ditch at the park and they start declaring you this and that."
Bender, I was enjoying it until you guys showed up.
Fry, Hermes?
Farnsworth," Another one of your ill-timed jokes, Fry?!"
Leela, And we'll never see if boyish smile and hair horn again. But I bet he went back to his own time. I'm sure he was very happy and lived to a ripe old age.
Bender," Forbidden shmer-shmidden! What are they gonna do, write a letter? Ooh, I'm so scared!"
Farnsworth," The ship's escape pod! What happened up there, Johnny?"
Bender, Ooh! I'd take one of those with a side of chili fries.
Amy, I'll be ready then.
Bender, Of course not. A lady that fine you gotta romance first.
Leela, Would you like us to ... put you out of your misery?
Bender," Lessons? Oh, that's rich! Isn't it time you gave up all hope of ever improving yourself in any way?"
Fry, Gotta go!
Bender, I can. Robots do everything faster. Including evolving and believing how quickly things spring up.
Leela, What? Ow!
Fry, No!
Leela, Stop! Stop flattering me!
Bender," Oh! Ow, that hurt! Oh!"
Bender, Yeah!
Zoidberg, Do I ask her to mate now?
Leela, Space pirates!
Zoidberg," So, I guess everything worked out fine."
Fry," You're right, Professor. We might not be a traditional family like the Murphy's next door or the lesbian coven across the street. But we are a family and That Guy understands that."
Amy," Be careful, my little, teeny, greeny weenie."
Fry," Well, I went to another universe, and I fell in love with a giant octopus, and now I'm pope of a new religion."
Bender," You'll be safe in here, sweetheart. Get lost, Pavarotti!"
Fry," Now that I can do. I have a terrible secret to confess, Mr. DiCaprio. I'm not very smart."
Farnsworth," Who? Oh, my son. Don't worry, he's been safely abandoned with his godfather."
Bender, And Superking! The best one of the three!
Amy," I think they want wives, so just play along. If it doesn't work out, we'll still get half their rocks."
Bender, Porn. Porn. Free porn. Get rich watching porn? I find that rather hard to believe.
Bender, Time? I can't go back there.
Leela," Monday Monkey lives for the weekend, sir."
Fry, No.
Leela, Then that's what I am! Hi-yah!
Fry, A new age has begun. The age of the tentacle! Open your necks and receive the love!
Leela," No way, Jose-bot. I never wanna see those other orphans again! Not after the way they used to pick on me."
Bender," Ah! I have everything I every wanted. Money, wealth, riches. Yet something's missing. A hot princess with which to get(?) grizzly."
Leela," Oh, no. I'm not gonna expose the Honeybun Hideout. Where are you?"
Bender, Hey!
Farnsworth," Oh, poor Guenter."
Bender, He's throwing us in prison.
Bender," Watch me, poor man."
Fry, Don't you get it? She's smothering me.
Farnsworth," Ooh, that reminds me  You've all taken your pressure pills, right?"
Leela, Sorry I stormed out before. I didn't mean to ruin everyone's Xmas.
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! We were supposed to make a delivery to the planet Tweenis 12 but it's been completely destroyed."
Farnsworth, I'd like everyone to meet our new employees. Which ones are new?
Leela, Nothing.
Bender, Now did you say you were off to see the Professor? 'Cause I could use a heart -- a human heart. I need to pump a lot of blood out of my basement.
Bender, Or like how Rembrandt was blind and had wooden hands.
Bender, Looking at one's cards is a crutch for players who rely on skill.
Farnsworth, Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Fry?
Bender," Okay, but if it's culturally biased, I'm suing your ass."
Leela, Ow!
Amy," Here I come, Kif!"
Bender, Gah! I once knew a guy ... you look like him. But he wasn't either. I'm a good captain.
Bender, Aw!
Bender, Yes! The rich get richer!
Hermes," Very good, Amy!"
Bender," Yo, old guy, why do we have to use those tiny micro-droids? Can't you just shrink us?"
Bender," Y'know, I was God once."
Amy, Big deal!
Leela, Stop being ridiculous. There's no such thing as whatever you're saying.
Bender, Pft! Bodies are for hookers and fat people! All I need is a wad of cash with a head wrapped around it.
Fry, Even bigger than those? Holy nuts! Where is it?
Farnsworth, You will be punished.
Fry, Absolutely.
Leela, This is it! The moment we should've trained for!
Bender," Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here? Oh, ho! What's this?"
Bender, Well obviously I need floozies! Let's roll!
Zoidberg," Well, here's your problem, right here. You've got a skull embedded in your head."
Farnsworth," With my last breath I curse Zoidberg! Pazuzu! Oh, you came back to me!"
Farnsworth, My wha?
Fry, Leela? How did you get past my sumo ninjas?
Fry, D-D-Did you just talk?
Bender, No one? Your mama? Shut up? Take your pick.
Hermes, Faster!
Bender, Alright!
Bender," I got a downgrade! I'm a steam-powered wooden robot, just as nature intended. Therefore, I must kill Robot 1-X."
Bender," (laughs) I feel great, and I owe it all to Calculon. His visit really inspired me. I finally know what I want to be when I grow up."
Leela," Alright, don't panic. If we can get to the ship, we can fly north and hide under the polar icecaps for a few weeks."
Zoidberg," Thanks for the help, Leela."
Bender, Yep. Every chef knows that this is the place to get exotic gourmet ingredients.
Fry, But-- But won't that change history?
Zoidberg, Don't feel bad.  At least you're not Leela.
Zoidberg, Mazel tov!
Hermes," How can you look me in the eye 'n eye and say that? I'm nothin' but a brain. A useless, filthy brain."
Farnsworth, But it's good for a lifetime.
Farnsworth," Eh, let me just insert lens in microscope. There! Now, for the first time, we may be able to see the infinitesimal fabric of matter itself. Laying bare the most fundamental laws of the universe!"
Bender, I'll tell you who I remember. Anopsis ... Pleotut ... Whatshisname. He was the greatest of all.
Bender, We're making beer. I'm the brewery.
Amy, This is Bolt Rolands. Bolt is a hyper-sled racer with 10 wins on the pro-circuit.
Leela," Hi, Bender. We'd like to adopt a child."
Fry," OK, she's all restocked with emergency jam. Let's get going."
Fry, What's Parade Day?
Leela," Don't worry, Fry. Things look bad but I still have a trump card; the most beautiful love song ever written. (singing badly) And I will always love you, Will always love you."
Fry, Hey!
Bender," Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess ... and my banjo. And Fry."
Fry, And then the battle's not so bad?
Amy, Bender!
Farnsworth," I can't live forever and I need an heir. Someone to spend my vast riches and take care of my man-eating anteaters when I'm gone. The others simply aren't level-headed enough. They're too impulsive. Not like you. Not like old, predictable, dull-as-dishwater Leela."
Hermes," Fry, mon, if you're going to be living in the office you could at least be on time for work."
Farnsworth, So!?  What of it?
Bender, Huh? What?
Fry, You know what movies average out to be really good? The first six Star Trek movies!
Fry, Woo!
Fry," Ooh! Hey, Amy!"
Hermes, It all sounds good.
Fry," Hey, hey. What's wrong? Was it something Leela said?"
Bender, The Achilles heel of the Ronco design is its structural resonance frequency. Allow me. There we go!
Leela, Congratulations!
Leela, It's a sick and twisted book of holiness all right.
Leela, What? You're gonna wipe out 10% of the galaxy for a stupid golf course?
Leela, I'll think of something.
Farnsworth," Leela, could you come in here for a moment. I have something important to tell you."
Zoidberg," You're on in five minutes, Excellency. You sure you don't want your comedy pope staff?"
Hermes, You want to co-star in his TV show? Like that time you already did that?
Zoidberg," A Tritonian Yeti?! You two aren't up to anything unethical, are you?!"
Farnsworth," Say, on this exact date, the Continental Congress was meeting secretly in New York. Maybe they can help us."
Amy, No way!
Hermes, Wrong.
Bender, Wow!
Farnsworth, No time off.
Farnsworth, Guenter is my experiment. He was the top secret contents of this stinking crate.
Bender," Ah, wrong. Right now you're ass-deep in a folding chair."
Fry, Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds of pounds and sound crummy?
Fry, I'm sorry. I was up really late poking through people's desks.
Fry," I meant the sound Bigfoot just made. He's been sighted a lot in this area recently. Just last week, a blind hiker felt him."
Farnsworth, Of course.
Amy, No thanks.
Fry," Stop! The robot's not your enemy! He's just a poor, misunderstood--"
Amy," But it's time to discuss a pressing issue, the right to marry who, or what, we want!"
Farnsworth," ""Flexo's great,"" you say? Well that's good enough for me. Welcome aboard, lad."
Farnsworth, I'm almost finish reconfiguring the ships propulsion system. We can leave as soon as the paper-mâché is dry.
Leela, Aw! They're so cute! They're like if puppies and kittens could have babies!
Leela," Fry, look.. It really is beautiful. I don't know why I never noticed before."
Fry," Professor, my Fry-fro's all frizzy."
Leela, No.
Fry, That's thinkin' like a man.
Bender, That's the great thing about that hand.
Fry, Uh...
Fry, A mermaid!
Bender," Not that ceilin' fan. In fact, lookin' ahead, it's obvious Mom won't allow me to stay accelerated like this. Hmmm. Who's up for a turkey dinner an' a game o' badminton?"
Bender," Oh, flexible. That would go good up my spine."
Leela, Hi-yah!
Leela," Bender, do you know who that was?"
Farnsworth, Over here is Wong Library. It has the largest collection of literature in the Western Universe.
Farnsworth," You, fat as the queen of sea cows."
Zoidberg, You know Zapp Brannigan?
Fry, Just get outta here. Go!
Bender, Huh?
Farnsworth," Hey, Mr. Perfect? You wet the chair."
Fry, Very impressive. Back in the 20th century we had no idea there was a university on Mars.
Bender, Not the magnet! No! No! No-- Uh-oh!
Farnsworth," You've got a bright future, Amy. As sure as the Sun sets in the east."
Farnsworth, Burning garbage!
Fry, Silent? You've been meddling for two solid weeks.
Fry," Oh, I was confused because the scoreboard says something different."
Bender," I'm sorry, Fry. But some games you just can't win. Cubert and the Professor are guilty. The jury will vote to convict. I can't change that."
Zoidberg," So you wish you were never born, maybe?"
Fry," Well, that's because he was bitten by a radioactive superman!"
Fry," Yivo. Yivo is the lover of all beings, male and female. But Yivo has no gender, thus Yivo has proclaimed that instead of ""he"" or ""she,"" we are to use the word ""shklee."" And instead of ""him"" or ""her,"" we are to use the word ""shklim,"" or ""shkler."""
Bender, Hey! Save some for me!
Amy, Leave Todd out of this!
Bender, You shot me! You miserable dingus!
Fry," On second thought, I'll take that one."
Fry," Ow! Stop it! Down, boy! Bad president!"
Fry," A little. You OK, Bender?"
Bender," Oh, my God. Are you God?"
Bender," Well, I do think of human life as expendable."
Leela, We've all talked it over and--
Leela," Has anyone seen Bender? Bender? Here robot, robot, robot."
Farnsworth, Wha?
Farnsworth," Yes, you idiot. The circuit diagram is right here on the inside of your case."
Leela, Bender raises a good point  Where is Fry?
Fry," Stop. Somewhere, some time, Leela's waiting for me. We need to keep looking for a backwards time machine."
Farnsworth," Hey! Unless this is a nude love-in, get the hell off my property!"
Farnsworth, Oh! So close.
Leela," Don't you understand, numb-neck? He doesn't love me!"
Fry, That's a stupid animal. You're stupid! I said I want the best one. Now which costs more? The parrot or the Stink Lizard?
Farnsworth," Oh, no no no, much worse."
Zoidberg," I'd love to, but first I have to perform surgery. I kid! I kid!"
Leela, I'm surprised you lived through that sentence.
Farnsworth, Oh!
Bender, Someone's acting awfully aluminum.
Amy," Smeesh, Professor. Don't have a schmaneurysm. Fry's your distant relative."
Farnsworth, I'm well aware of that.
Fry," Also, I didn't know buggalo could fly."
Bender, Roberto! What are you doin' here?
Leela, Wow! How did you do it.
Leela, It comes with the job.
Bender," Say, buddy, why's this Grand Cigar so pricey?"
Leela," You see Emperor Plon here? He met his end when he was drunk by Emperor Strug. And before he could even wipe his mouth, Strug was drunk by Shwab."
Leela," Quick, hand me my machete! We can still save his legs!"
Hermes," Like Granny said, ""If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself."" God rest her zombie bones."
Farnsworth," Well, well. If it isn't our little munchkin moguls!"
Zoidberg, Aw.
Bender," Oh, Lordy!"
Leela, There.
Bender, I'm in tremendous pain here.
Bender, How we doing?
Bender, Like putting too much air in a balloon!
Farnsworth, Wait. There are no more questions left to answer.
Fry," It's too late, Leela. He's good, old Bender again. 'E's totally useless."
Leela, Amy!
Fry," Man, there's clouds of exhaust everywhere."
Fry," What's the word, uh, sir?"
Bender," Oh, crap, that is what I am!"
Fry," Hey, uh, what was the purpose of life anyway?"
Zoidberg, My name isn't Slick. It's Zoidberg. John-ing Zoidberg!
Bender, Bend me!
Farnsworth," Yes, but they won't listen. Everyone's always in favour of saving Hitler's brain but when you put it in the body of a great white shark, ooh, suddenly you've gone too far."
Leela, Come on!  Let's buy some eyePhones on line!
Bender," Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter, batter! Hey, batter, batter! Duck!"
Farnsworth, It's my sentimental favorite.
Hermes, That's not a cigar. Uh ... and it's not mine!
Farnsworth," Ah, here's my stateroom."
Leela, This is the first actual work you've ever had to do around here.
Fry," Thank you, Lars."
Bender," Cram a ham in it, you twerps! Sorry!"
Bender, So I gotta hide forever?!
Farnsworth," Bender, old bot, the Mafia thinks you're dead! You can come back to work with us!"
Farnsworth, I suppose it is technically possible. Though I am already in my pyjamas.
Fry, But it's a fight to the death!
Bender," Hey, lay off me. TV would stink if everyone on it was a positive role model. Bender is about entertainment, baby! You can't hold me responsible for what kids do when-- Hey! This is my stuff they stole! That's the last straw! Bender should not be allowed on television!"
Leela, Firing pocket rocket!
Leela, How is this possible? And can you believe she wore a tank top to my funeral?
Hermes, Likewise.
Fry," Say, Bender, can I hold that map for a second?"
Farnsworth," There's one thing I don't understand, Zoidberg. How did you persuade Mom to give you her precious Yeti head? Did you 'ave to promise anything in return?"
Fry, I could vomit or urinate. Would you feel better about that?
Fry," OK, here I go."
Leela, Could you give me some help? I think Bender crushed my foot.
Farnsworth," Yes, but something he saw on that mission traumatised 'im so severely, he grew hair! Just so it could turn white! Sadly, my brave crew was gone forever."
Zoidberg, Of course I'm being irrational! I'm in love!
Fry, That'll show him.
Fry," Well, it's... it's about my friend Bender."
Bender, Beer?
Farnsworth," Oh, we're doomed! Every year we're doomed. Thanks be I had these bullet-proof shutters installed."
Bender, I'll try to keep that in mind!
Farnsworth," You know, romance is an important part of our work too. Uh, right, everyone?"
Amy, I think I'll go and fill up on bisque at the buffet.
Leela," Fry, what the hell were you people thinking back then? How could you just throw your garbage away?"
Farnsworth," Bender, be careful. That's the ship's diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable."
Fry, Rrrmrrrmrrrfrrrmrrr or what?
Fry," Hey, hey."
Fry," Aww. That's terrible, Leela. But imagine the look on their faces when you show up with two friends who eat all the hors d'Oeuvres."
Bender, That's some good money.
Fry," Yeah? He may 'ave brains, but I 'ave heart."
Leela, I'm OK with it.
Farnsworth," Well, duh! She's programmed to like you!"
Leela," Look, I don't know about any of your previous captains but I intend to do as little dying as possible."
Leela," Yeah, we know a great place in the mountains. We could take you there for a romantic dinner under the stars."
Leela, I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you.
Bender, Bingo!
Amy, Kif has asked me to be his Fonfon Ru.
Fry, Kinda game-y.
Farnsworth," Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? To shreds, you say. Very well then. Sad, sad, terrible, gruesome news about my colleague, Dr. Mbutu."
Hermes," The what? Oh, right."
Amy," Well, there I was at Elzar's, eating a nice pork sundae and suddenly, I just lost my appetite. Forever."
Bender," Hey, everyone do The Bender! This move's called The Bender!"
Bender," Hey, Fishy. I've been meaning to write you about your in-store kiddie parks. The slides won't support an adult robot."
Fry, I thought it would fit.
Farnsworth," Would you all chill! I can't think with you kids cramping my style! Oh, I need a babysitter."
Leela," Aw, calm down. I'm sure Bender is taking this just as hard as you are."
Hermes," Hey, you wanna celebrate our escape? Maybe grab a shot of tequila and take in a big-league cockfight?"
Leela, And here's when I dropped out and bummed around India for a while.
Farnsworth, Poodle spit! 53 years old? Now I'll need a fake ID to rent ultra-porn.
Farnsworth, And be careful with that crystal.
Farnsworth," Alas, no. Oh, Bender, I'm afraid it's a symptom of a fatal defect."
Fry, Maybe he likes it here in Hell.
Bender," You all go without me. I'm gonna take one last look around. You know, for, uh, stuff to steal."
Fry," Well, we missed the premiere and we're gonna die. We might as well enjoy the sights. Oh, my God! Sylvester Stallone!"
Leela," Bender, shush. You're supposed to be dead."
Leela," Now, they may ask for a DNA sample."
Leela, Look.  What are those huge letters?
Hermes, I thought you were only gonna take out one vertebra!
Zoidberg, Fry did it!
Fry," Hey, you know what always cheers you up? Baking me a nice tray of sugar cookies!"
Bender," Here's your Gutenberg Bible master. Plus the Colonel's secret recipe  Chicken, Grease, Salt."
Bender," All those times I said ""Kill all humans,"" I'd always whisper ""except one"". Fry was that one. And I never told him so!"
Leela," Bender, you need to go to the police and tell them a tastefully edited version of what you just said."
Amy, What about Umbriel?
Fry, The fabulous person!
Fry, Like what?
Fry," Wow, you even look beautiful in 2D."
Bender," It's so unfair! I have eight other senses, but I'd trade them all, even smission, to be able to taste."
Fry, There you go.
Bender," Sir, you forget yourself!"
Fry, Bah! I think she looked fine before.
Bender," Oh, crap."
Fry," Uh, Fry."
Bender," A reunion at your old orphanarium, eh? You gonna go?"
Fry, Ten hundred percent!
Fry, Looks like it's full of dig dogs.
Leela," Bender! Cut it out! First of all, the sewer mutants will be mad. Second, everything else that's horribly wrong with what you're doing!"
Farnsworth," To prevent the soufflé from exploding, Bender will carry it. He's gyroscopically stable."
Fry, I care! I care plenty! I just don't know how to make them stop!
Bender," Man, this is fun on a bun. Here I go again."
Bender," What to do, what to do? One $300 hookerbot or 300 $1 hookerbots?"
Bender," I was wondering where I put that. Hey, now I feel much better! Thanks, Professor. And, Amy, I'm sorry I took your watch."
Bender, We've got to stem this tidal wave of moral decay. It's time to shut down nappster.com!
Bender," Oh, it's true. But we're star-crossed robots. She, a countess, built with a silver spoon in her mouth. And me, just a regular honest Joe."
Hermes," Up yours, Zoidberg. Up wherever your species traditionally crams things. The only sensible way to choose a successor is with a limbo contest."
Farnsworth, Move over God! Prepare for rebirth! Wrong switch.
Amy, That's it? You hate robosexual 'cause your girlfriend left you for a robot?
Leela, Oh! You know who could help with that?! Francis!
Bender, Whee!
Leela," Oh, don't mind him. I'II turn him off."
Leela, I'm from Peru.
Farnsworth," I must tell you Hedonismbot, I hate to sell my doomsday devices to a private collector. But with my business stolen I have to make ends meet. You will be careful?"
Hermes, What vulnerable opening?
Fry," I'm telling you, Leela was cool, she was in command, and when she kicked people it hurt. It really hurt."
Leela, Wait! I know you! You're Abner Doubledeal!
Leela," Oh, Lord!"
Amy," It may sound strange, but seeing Kif's mutilated remains poured into the mud made me really sad."
Leela, No. One week.
Fry," No, Colleen. I'm making a romantic toast."
Farnsworth," Even I laughed at me when I built this alien cross-species genetic analyser. But I guess I showed myself! Subjects, please enter the chamber. Now to take a DNA sample. When I pull this switch, the maternifuge will spin at 10,000 RPM, separating out everyone who isn't the mother-- Father-- Whatever!"
Bender, Are you sure? Maybe I should sneak a peek at your access panel.
Zoidberg, Not if you've lived a life without regret.
Farnsworth," Damn right we are! Now come on, let's go do a little father-son weaselling out of this."
Bender," Elzar, I'm a walking pile of your unfinished business!"
Bender, Right!
Bender," It's pwonounced ""cweam""."
Leela, Now take me to the hospital and put my eye back the way it was. Right now!
Zoidberg," She's right, I mean, sure, they got the Braves but it's a third-rate symphony."
Fry, I'll have to do better than that.
Bender, Looks like one of us will have to bend this grate.
Leela, Look! All the Presidents are back! Even John Tyler!
Leela, Guidance system?
Bender," Thank you. Your Honor, this meat-man does not deny that we robots are the glorious products of evolution. He claim only to have played a small role in supplying the initial machinery. I ask you, is that so crazy? Yes, it's completely crazy, and that is why you must find him not guilty by reason of insanity!"
Leela, So we're stuck here until someone finds us?
Bender," Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah..."
Fry," Hmm. Finding God. That-That's important, yeah. But you know what might be a treat for everyone? If you let me use the telescope to find my lost friend, Bender."
Leela, Wait a second! There's a microwave radar dish at the army base.  We could steal it!
Fry," So, what? Shorts?"
Fry," Bender, I'm alive! You didn't hurt me at all. But I know you wanted to, and that's what matters. Here's to you."
Fry," Good thing Gedgie won. My dumb experiment wouldn't've lasted an hour in space, let alone a thousand years. Besides, Buzz Aldrin ran over my guinea pig in the parking lot."
Bender, Uh ... me no speaka the English.
Fry, I didn't come here to see any activity involving two guys. Where do you people do your erotic display?
Fry," Hey, you guys, the most amazing thing happened. It's two-for-one Tuesday at Krispy Kreme! Plus there's mermaids."
Bender," Professor, I've never asked for anything before, but seeing those fembots glistening with oil means more to me than life itself."
Fry, But I'm not a robot like you. I don't like having discs crammed into me. Unless they're Oreos -- and then only in the mouth! Don't you understand? I'm gonna die here!
Fry," Hi, Hutch. So what's with the obnoxious, shrieking voices? Are my fillings picking up The View?"
Leela," I wish I could come with you to say goodbye, before you all turn back in to grown-ups but I'm grounded for knocking the school over."
Fry, This isn't Slurm at all!
Bender," Maybe she'd come back to you if your best friend Bender were a Globetrotter. What do you say, Bubblegum?"
Fry, Why?
Fry, Thank you for using Planet Express.
Bender," Sure thing, pal."
Amy," Pfft, great putt, Dad."
Amy, Bender!
Leela, Mutilation is never easy.
Fry," Hey, where's Amy and Bender?"
Fry," Well, he must be afraid to break character in case there's any Robot Mafia scuzzballs around."
Bender," Master Spargle, if you can hear me up there in that ditch where I left you, this is for you."
Bender," Well, if that new guy can't handle things, gimme a call."
Bender, Kill all humans ... kill all humans ... must kill all the humans.
Farnsworth, Draining male oil. Infusing female oil. Removing item.
Bender, Let's take these six Jim Carrey movies and record over them.
Amy," Here? But, uh, wouldn't it be crowded?"
Bender, Shut up and get to the point!
Farnsworth," What say you, Single Female Lawyer?"
Bender," I did it! I escaped! But to what kind of a life? I'm too scared to get the upgrade but I can't face my friends again without it. And so I set sail for unknown shores. Oh, merciful Poseidon, take pity on this mechanical mariner. Oh, jeez!"
Fry, Incoming torpedoes. Shields at maximum yarnell!
Fry, There's this girl who I really like but she thinks I'm a jerk. Can you help me?
Zoidberg, Zoidberg!
Bender, Fine. I'll head over to the other side. Good luck fishing on this side!
Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes."
Leela," Oh, no! My sunglasses were in there!"
Farnsworth, Indeed. That's why I bought one to help around the office.
Fry," Hey, Hermes!"
Bender," Hmm, they say you shouldn't give out your e-mail address."
Leela, Lrrr! Put a stop to this right now!
Farnsworth," Dear God, no!"
Fry," Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby."
Leela," Moderately-priced, domestic, non-vintage champagne? How did you know?"
Leela, I say me.
Amy, Is it a new party board?
Fry, I don't know. Somethin' about Xmas just doesn't feel like Christmas.
Hermes," This way, please."
Fry," Umm, too much romance, not enough human killing."
Leela, Burn on that old crew! The only things they did better than us were suck and die!
Bender, Let's make it interesting.
Zoidberg," I can't stop. When I eat too much dirt, I get stuff in my throat."
Bender," Yo, Amy, I'm in the slammer."
Zoidberg," So you're in pain and 'ave a bunch o' needles. I prescribe acupuncture. Let's begin. Blood?! I mean, ""Blood."""
Fry," No, he was a bad friend. I want him back right now."
Leela, I met him at that charity cock fight last week. He's the mayor's aide.
Fry, Oh no! I'm late for work again!
Bender," Eh, they're all pretty unimpressive."
Bender," Okay, we finished digging this shallow grave. Can we go now?"
Bender," I'll always remember you, Hermenthotip!"
Farnsworth, Faster! Faster! Just drop me off at that asteroid over there.
Zoidberg," All 6,000 hulls have been breached!"
Farnsworth, We don't know. It could kill millions or nobody. I suppose it might even bring a few people back to life! Anything is possible in science.
Farnsworth," I'm sorry, Fry, but no vegetarian could've done this."
Fry," I hope so, Leela."
Leela, Ooh! Was it jazz noodling? My ex-boyfriend Sean played the sax. I used to listen for hours while he sat naked on my couch and improvised.
Fry, Philip J. Fry.
Leela, That's Earth. The planet we live on.
Farnsworth, And what's this layer of ozone? That's never been there before.
Leela, Surveillance?
Fry, I say no.
Bender," Uh, wait, old ... spice. Let me have a go at this mechanised chap. I can be quite the rough customer."
Bender, Nope.
Zoidberg, What? Now there's a bird involved?
Bender," Oh, God! Fry, I'm so glad to see you. I didn't hurt you, did I?"
Fry," No, Professor, don't give up. There were plenty of times in my century when I was gonna give up but I never did. Never! Hey, are you even listening to me? Oh, I give up!"
Fry, I could never shoot you! Never! You taught me how to shave.
Hermes, That's almost 10 per year.
Hermes, I'm feeling dread deep in my dreads!
Farnsworth, Good. Fry's ejection indicates that he is not the man-mom. Nor is Captain Brannigan.
Bender," Hey, pookums! Contrary to what I was saying earlier, melding minds with you would be extremely bearable."
Fry," Gosh, yes. I've tried an' tried, but, so far, I only got Amy pregnant."
Leela, Right. If they try to look in the box.
Leela, Merry Xmas.
Amy, Yeah!
Fry, Of course not.
Farnsworth," I expect you'll want to see my angry, crotchety, grandpa discount card."
Leela," Captain Fuzzytoes reporting for duty. I mean, cutie."
Bender, Alright! Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!
Leela, Yeah!
Fry," We've lost power to the forward Game Boy, Mario not responding!"
Leela, But you never wore your ring. I didn't know you had a wife.
Fry," Bender, are you OK?"
Fry, This is the saddest day of my life. And I still can't cry.
Bender, Like you have a choice. So what's your problem?
Fry," Hey, I have an idea. Who wants to cram in my van and follow Bender on tour and live there, in the van?"
Farnsworth," Hush, lad. I'm totally in the zone."
Farnsworth, I'd rather kill myself.
Leela," Oh, I completely forgot. I left my apartment on fire!"
Leela, Yah!
Fry, No. Do you?
Amy," Earth will come to a stop, and..."
Hermes," What's got into him? He's twitching like Zoidberg when someone mentions the word ""food""."
Farnsworth," Well, it took almost twelve hours, but it's finished."
Bender," Stupid anti-pimping laws! Well, pay the man!"
Leela, Come on. Everybody help out Fry.
Fry," Happy birthday, Leela. I'm really sorry I'm gonna be one minute late, 'cause we're testing the professor's dumb time machine."
Bender, TV party tonight!
Amy, Can I have a fluke?
Bender," I'm going too fast. I've gotta lose momentum. I'm gonna spend eternity alone with barely any swag. Ooh! Hey, universe, check out the dude with the Rolex! Wow! Ostentatious! Except what good is a candelabra without-- Wait! I know! Ah, the pity. Fated to drift forever through the void as gravity's plaything. Oh, cruel fate, to be thusly boned. Ask not for whom the bone bones. It bones for thee. The only thing that keeps me sane is the thought that I have all eternity in which to perfect my art. Damn you!"
Fry," Oh, the fools! If only they'd built it with 6,001 hulls! When will they learn?"
Fry," Oh, Bender, Bender, I missed you so much! Hey, wait. Did you haunt me?"
Bender, Mmm! Why didn't anyone tell me tasting things tasted so good? What's going on? That rhythm! It's doing something to my human butt.
Leela," Officer, would it be alright if we adopted one of the kids?"
Fry, That's right.
Farnsworth, Hmm.
Bender, Beer! Beer!
Fry, Wait. I'm not going with you.
Bender, Aha!
Zoidberg, It's all so complicated with the flowers and the romance and the lies upon lies.
Amy, That's an awful lot of eagle.
Amy," Colossal tooth whitener, mega deodorant, humongous acne cream... Aw, and one regular-sized condom."
Leela, I've never seen anyone so addicted to Slurm.
Bender, I'm considerin' buyin' a yacht to house my Thoroughbreds. How d'you expect me to do that without smokin' a cigar?
Bender, It's me! No one else look in this mirror!
Bender, Fleeing somewhere?
Fry, Everybody wins!
Bender, Wheeeeeeee.
Leela," Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but you've become a fat sack of crap."
Bender, Mine is called a droidel and it's rigged to make you pay.
Leela, He has so much stuff. He won't miss this.
Bender," And he needs help. Now, I don't like you and you don't like me."
Bender," Ooh, me! Everyone watch how good I am. And the crowd goes wild! What prize do I get? Cash?"
Amy, Kif! Hold on!
Bender," Well it ain't my fault. I'm a non-voting felon, thank you."
Amy," I hate to complain about the heat, but the air conditioner is on fire!"
Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for, uh ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud!"
Bender," True. I've always dreamt of being an emperor. You know, for Halloween, and then forever. But heisting those jewels would be difficult."
Amy, Wait. Wait. Drop the boot!
Fry, Well at least we get a window!
Bender," Hey, there he is again. And he brought nerds! Take this!"
Leela, What?
Leela, Maybe — Maybe this was meant to be. Maybe you and I were meant to build a new world here.
Amy," Yeah! Wait, what?"
Amy," Hey, it is kinda like that."
Farnsworth," Things only rhyme below ten to the minus five angstroms, you dope! Now, ions an' pions, muons an' gluons, neutrinos, gravitinos... We're closing in on the very smallest particles of matter! For the first time, we're about to observe the fundamental structure of the universe. Such detail. Such finely wrought intricate beauty!"
Hermes, But that's what gave 'im Yetiism in the first place! Won't it just make 'im a double Yeti?!
Bender," Curse you, merciful Poseidon!"
Leela," Look, are you going to rescue us or not?"
Zoidberg," And in this corner, Zoidberg! C'mon! Lighten up! What is this, a funeral?"
Fry, I guess he didn't hear me.
Amy," Me too, now that I'm used to it."
Farnsworth," I'm sorry, but penmanship counts."
Leela," Yeah, it's pathetic alright! How much?"
Fry," Hey, Bender?"
Amy, And dodo birds.
Bender, Yes.
Bender, With what?
Amy, Blug! Which one did they go into?
Amy, Something's wrong. It's way too quiet.
Bender, But what about our motto? Doesn't it mean anything?
Fry, Really?! I'm gonna lick Herbert Hoover's head!
Leela, Zapp?
Farnsworth," Let's go, damnit! Let's go!"
Fry, Was Planet Express built on an Indian graveyard?
Fry, Ow!
Bender," Howdy, chief. For my next bout, what do you say I fight these two bimbos in some mud?"
Leela," No, just a regular mistake. For a split second my common sense was overwhelmed by pity."
Bender," Chocolate, Mac, men. The end."
Bender, Demand suddenly skyrocketed. You all saw it!
Farnsworth, They fit together?
Farnsworth, We just wanna come in and rummage about a bit.
Leela, What were they used for?
Bender," Look, everyone loves killing people, but I don't wanna hurt my friends."
Leela," I don't mean to offend, but this tastes like vomit."
Farnsworth, Something's wrong! She's not responding to my poking stick.
Bender, Or what?
Farnsworth, What is happening?
Bender," Step aside, lady. Like everything else in life, pumping is just a primitive, degenerate form of bending. C'mon, Bender, pump harder! Harder! I'm trying as hard as I can. Harder, damn you!"
Bender," Shut up, baby, you love it."
Farnsworth," How did you get this number? Hermes, hang up on him in the rudest possible manner."
Bender, Mind your own business and get out!
Bender, That's not Mr. Peppy!
Leela, It's Fry!
Fry, No I mighn't. I can't even remember my mother's maiden name.
Fry, Ha! That barely hurt Leela at all!
Leela," Yeah! I mean, he might not have a case, but I'm genuinely not human."
Farnsworth," Oh, it's terrible. Just terrible. Well, clear out your desks and move along. Chop-chop."
Hermes," First person on Mars? Oh, so your brother was that Philip J. Fry."
Hermes, I sure do.
Fry," So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And I hope there are no hard feelings about your date, or stuff."
Leela, Just leave us alone and let us clear out our lockers.
Fry," Aw. There, there. If it makes you feel any better, his body was vaporised so there's no chance of him coming back as a zombie."
Farnsworth, Let's see what's under the Last Supper.
Bender, We pollute too much. We're destroying the world and killing the turtles.
Farnsworth," And so dies our hope of solving this mystery. Come on gang, let's go home. Wait! Let's not give up so easily. Animatronio mentioned a fountain. That's a statue of Neptune, god of water. The number of points on him trident is three, or trey. The ""u"" in his name is written like ""v"". Trey, ""v"". Trevi! It's the Trevi Fountain. There can be no question!"
Leela," I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again you screwed up. Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas."
Leela," Oh, you mean Xmas. You must be using an archaic pronunciation. Like when you say ""ask"" instead of ""aks""."
Fry, Maybe I am... LL Fool J!
Leela, Who's she?
Bender," 'Allo, big beak! Too slow!  Missed me again! Me footcup! I'll stab you!"
Leela," I told you to turn around and go back to the park. But oh, no, the park was too phoney. We had to see the real moon."
Zoidberg," Trust me, two out of three doesn't cut it!"
Bender," She'll be riding six white horses when she comes, She'll be riding six white horses when she comes--"
Leela, What about the Great Stone Ass of Mars?
Bender, I wanted to watch you remember me.
Bender, Sure. Ow!
Farnsworth, Wernstrom!
Leela," Nah. I'm not in the mood for a historical documentary. I've heard good things about Quizblorg, Quizblorg."
Hermes, Uh-oh. What's that loud digesting sound?
Farnsworth," Yuhoo, boys! What's this era in human history like?"
Bender," Alright, let's get to work! I'll be out in a second."
Farnsworth, That's a big crock of-- Hold me!
Farnsworth," I also taught you not to get caught! Oh, I wish I'd never cloned you."
Fry," Let's see what tools we'll need. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Alright, we're all set."
Bender," Wooo! I'm so full of luck, it's shooting out like luck diarrhoea."
Bender," Oh, crap! It's a miracle!"
Farnsworth," No showboarding, you atomic hotdog!"
Fry," But, but ... Bender need brain ... for ... smart making. What did you do now? Stop doing things!"
Fry," OK, let's go through this once more--"
Zoidberg," Maybe so, but perhaps if I wrote him and asked for a few hundred pointers..."
Bender, Fry?
Fry," I'm here to rescue Amy, uh... from her robosexual desires."
Fry, (VO) That's when it hit me again ...
Leela, Where are all the men in your society?
Zoidberg, I broke your television.
Leela," We can't take that chance. Move, people, move!"
Fry," Well he didn't check out. The ashtray's still here. Look, Nibbler's caught the scent of vodka and motor oil! Go, boy. Follow that stench."
Leela, Mind if we crash here tonight? The colours in the van are keeping us awake.
Leela, Bring beer.
Fry," Like my parents! Oh, wait, that was hitting."
Amy," Oh, they're so cute! What are their names?"
Hermes, Yes!
Farnsworth, Profanity.
Bender, You shot me. You miserable dingus!
Leela, You mean by beating them up? Because I've broken that blind kid's nose like 10 times and it doesn't make any difference.
Bender, You do now!
Fry," Sir! Yes, ma'am!"
Leela, I guess not.
Fry," Man, these guys rock harder than ever!"
Leela," Oh, right. Girls lack the will of the warrior!"
Hermes," Mon, that's some cheap-ass matter! What the hell is it?"
Hermes," Oh, no! We overslept."
Bender," Quiet, call coming in. Yes? A big endorsement deal for Leela? How much? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass! Deal!"
Fry, Ah! Don't eat my butt!
Zoidberg, You do and I'll-ing gut you like a fish!
Leela, That rat! Do something!
Leela," Fry, I just wanna try dating a normal man, who if you go somewhere with him no one says he's crummy. I think I deserve that once in life."
Zoidberg," No, no, no, no, no, of course not. Nobody but you. I'm afraid your body was badly damaged in the crash."
Zoidberg," You stink, loser."
Leela, I'm taking this bee with us. With a queen we can build a hive and make more honey ourselves. Let me just pack her a lunch and we'll go.
Amy, Mm-mm.
Fry," Well, I give up. What's the catch?"
Bender," Wow! The original party worm! Are you ready to get down, get funky with us?"
Farnsworth," I may be an old man. In fact, I'm fairly sure I am. But I'll put you Globetrotters in your place with my team of mutant atomic supermen!"
Leela," Hey, come on! Let's act like grown-ups here. Wanna race?"
Hermes," Business is down, so I filed papers to have you all reclassified as slaves."
Bender," That was the greatest thing ever! Let's party! Yeah, baby! C'mon!"
Fry," Well, this is it. You guys wait here. This is gonna kill him more than it does me. Goodbye, boy. I'll think of you whenever I sit on something round."
Fry," Hey, wait a minute! Isn't anyone gonna defend us?"
Farnsworth," It was as though I were living in a facility in Florida with hundreds of other old people. All day long we'd play bingo, eat oatmeal and wait for our children to call."
Fry, Ow! It bit my finger!
Fry, Yeah!
Bender," Oh, my God!"
Amy, Mom? Dad? You remember Kif?
Bender, A blank wall! Fame is mine!
Farnsworth," I'm sorry, ladies, but I must do this. Not for you, not for Bender, but for the proud people of Robonia!"
Leela," I can't. If I leave Alcazar, that's the end of the Cyclops race. And I won't let that happen. Even if it means a lifetime of unhappiness."
Fry," It's okay. I may not be clever, but I have a good heart. That's what my mom used to say."
Fry, Yes. And I have a message for you from Colonel Mitumbay! He says this ... ... is from Congo Jack.
Fry, So my efforts to establish diplomatic relations with the cactus people were doomed from the start.
Hermes," No, it's in all our contracts. Here's mine. ""All female employees must pose nude if requested."""
Bender," Yeah! Right on, nutcake!"
Leela, This is the exact location of the dump. But there's nothing here.
Bender, Humans are disgusting! I opened one up once. I almost barfed.
Hermes," I don't believe this! It's eating my bait! Beat it, you mooching crawdad!"
Leela," Look, um, I'm embarrassed to admit this but you forced me to  I can't go out tonight because... I have sweaty boot rash."
Leela, I can't help it. I was gonna be married. I was so happy.
Fry," It's all lies, every word of it! He wasn't original, he wasn't a Martian, he wasn't Philip Fry and since when is he a the?"
Farnsworth, But I'm doomed. I might as well capture a Yeti and die trying.
Bender, Philip?
Bender," Well, you meet half the qualifications."
Bender," Me neither. Food was good, though."
Amy," Bye, Fry and Leela!"
Hermes, What's with the kamikaz-bees?
Hermes, She's diving into the fourth dimension!
Fry," I told ya! Mr. Peppy's a lover, not a fighter. Like Dwayne ""The Rock"" ""The Tooth Fairy"" Johnson."
Fry," Man, how long is this gonna take?"
Fry," No, I'm just trying to fit my diction to the importance of what I'm saying. Please, let me speak."
Fry, Where are you? And me?
Leela," And now, to make sure you won't talk, I'm gonna have to do something really impulsive!"
Farnsworth," And the microwave radiation, combined with the gravitons and graviolis from the supernova, blasted us through time itself."
Bender, So... Anybody hungry?
Amy, Wait! I'm too rich to be kidnapped!
Leela, Oh!
Leela, Aw! They love you!
Leela," Oh, Chaz!"
Fry, Can I also guess Mom?
Bender," Well you should've gone poopy before it was time to run out on the check! C'mon! Go, go! Through the kitchen!"
Hermes," Oh, man, I'm inhaling these things! You guys scored some primo stuff here."
Fry, We gotta go rescue them!
Farnsworth," Good, startling news, everyone!"
Hermes, You went all the way to Holland already?
Fry, No! I swear!
Zoidberg, Fry? Are you alright?
Fry, Why isn't Leela back yet? Do you think she's okay?
Bender, Guys! Guys! Something's happening on television again.
Bender, Like whale barf.
Bender," Aw, they're so cute and harmless. No wonder you feel safe rippin' off their act."
Farnsworth," Okay, crew. Xmas break is over. It's time to destroy these gifts we forgot to deliver."
Bender," Wait, I know. I make use of my rod of fireballs."
Leela," It got through, Fry. It got through."
Zoidberg," Aye, what else now can go wrong?"
Bender, Where are we?
Bender, And maybe someday I won't listen.
Leela," Oh, that's ridiculous! (whispering) I'll take two pounds!"
Leela," Oh, sorry."
Fry, Nothing. I got rid of the worms.
Leela, I remember this from when we were kids  The warden would trot you out in front of prospective parents and they'd judge you like a piece of meat.
Leela," Quick, get in."
Farnsworth, You sound just like my tennis instructor.
Bender," Hang on, Scruffy! Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, one, one, one, zero, one, zero, zero, zero, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, one, zero, zero, one, one."
Fry, Dang! Sorry we missed it!
Amy, I'll do it for you.
Hermes, That's exactly what I was thinking.
Bender, Another classic science-fiction show cancelled before its time.
Amy," Well, they are giant diamonds."
Fry, Wow!
Leela," Hold still, Fry. I can reattach it with my emergency face laser."
Bender," Enough of your mindless chitchat, let's get going."
Zoidberg, Maybe a Parcheesi tournament.
Fry, Does the word Maltese mean anything to you?
Bender," But I suppose it's this medal I'm most proud of, Wiggles. I won it for saving the children of Earth from a giant kangaroo. It was on the Australian news, you probably didn't see it."
Farnsworth, Not now! Hypermalaria can lie dormant for years. Isn't that what you said?
Bender, It is?
Fry," Oh, sorry. Are you okay, Bender?"
Bender," Don't panic, I've got these yams. I'll just make some yam schnapps."
Leela, I don't care what Ms. Johnson says. That Guy's turning this place into some kind of business.
Bender, And mix them all together in a big jug.
Bender," Oh, OK. I thought you said ""romo""."
Bender," So then the hookerbot says, ""That's not my expansion slot"" and my friend says, ""That's not my gold-plated 25-pin connector!"""
Farnsworth," I see your mother, the water Mutant, didn't raise any fools, Turanga Leela. Our only hope is to communicate with the Aliens. And show them our peaceful intentions."
Fry, Kicked your ass!
Bender, I could?
Fry," Hey, Professor, great jerky!"
Leela, No. Now we're gonna die.
Bender, Fine. I'll be back in a few days.
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. Hermes and I have started a Bender protest group."
Fry, Try shocking him.
Leela," Get off me! I'm saving my neck for a rich, handsome Dracula."
Bender," Well, I'm tired of this room and everyone in it. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna pop over to the casino for the next 135 hours!"
Leela," Bender, he's got your body!"
Hermes, Spreadsheets were so elegant back then.
Amy, I'm in!
Farnsworth, You wish! You're in Los Angeles!
Farnsworth," Pine trees have been extinct for 800 years, Fry. Gone the way of the poodle and your primitive notions of modesty. Ah! Brisk!"
Hermes," Sweet candelabra of La Habra, LaBarbara! Isn't this the last night of Kwanzaa?"
Fry, Nah. If I ever wanna go back to the year 2000 I'll just freeze myself again.
Hermes," Yeah, right! As if you ever did anything charitable."
Farnsworth," You did it, Johnny. I'm cured!"
Bender, All aboard the party ship!
Fry, These things happen.
Amy," You're lookin' at her. Betsy's the only one left. She was curled up in my hamper when the storm hit. Aw, she likes you!"
Bender, Ooh! That feels funny! This is the Brooklyn-bound B-train making local stops at wherever the hell I feel like. Watch for the closing doors.
Leela," So, I'm not an alien? I'm a mutant."
Bender," Well, not totally! Before they reset me, I figured out the answers to life's great questions. Uh... This is the reason we exist. This is which ceilin' fans are gonna fall. Aha! Found it! Fry and Leela's Ultimate Fate... By Bender."
Hermes, Or like the Federation from your Star Trek programme.
Bender," Nah, this week I'm on Caught On Tape 3 'cause of what I did in the coffee pot."
Bender," And now, a man who needs no introduction. Fry, get up there!"
Leela," I should warn you, it's a little under-furnished."
Amy, Yeah.
Hermes, What oh?
Farnsworth," Just as I suspected. These robots were buried in improperly-shielded coffins. Their programming leaked into the castles wiring through this old, abandoned modem allowing them to project themselves as holograms."
Fry," Great, great. The one time I forgot to buy flight insurance!"
Fry," And so, to everyone and everything I've ever known, I say my last goodbye."
Leela, I see some movement up there. I think it's him.
Fry," Why do you always have to steal everything from me, Yancy? Find your own life and live it."
Bender, Bender's a genius.
Leela, No-one makes fun of my nose.
Amy, Maybe she's right about the lipstick.
Farnsworth," So, do we have the contract?"
Bender," Without a cat, you ain't going nowhere."
Hermes, Alright!
Farnsworth," Opal has unusual temporal properties. It preserves each head in a time-stasis bubble. Ergo, licking those heads actually sent us back in time to their original eras. Look!"
Hermes, I don't even know who this guy is!
Bender," Yeah, yeah, get on down! Oh, yeah! Drop another barnyard bomb on us, Vanilla Corn!"
Fry," No, thanks. That's robot food."
Fry," Mighty sir, we have nowhere to go. Could we please join your society?"
Farnsworth, But it's not boring!
Bender, I'll vote it down like a raise for school teachers!
Leela," When you were planning this peace ring, didn't you realise spaceships can move in three dimensions?"
Bender," Well, that's my good friend, Beck. I'm off to rock a series of mid-level venues."
Fry," Hey, jumbo! How would you like it if Leela said you were sexy and she wanted to make love with you?"
Zoidberg, You may feel a slight sawing!
Fry," Pizza delivery! Wow, so this is a real TV station, huh?"
Fry," Ah, I can't stand to see a robot cry. Let's watch TV!"
Fry, Hmmm. I consider myself almost completely ignorant of modern medicine. And I've never heard of Yetiism.
Bender, Oh... You're right. I'm great in every way except I have no imagination. All I ever wanted is to play this magical game and I can't.
Bender, Zapp Brannigan OK?
Fry, Leela's got a boyfriend!
Bender," Aye, Chihuahua!"
Zoidberg," Hmm. Don't worry, you'll be fine. Oh boy. I didn't have the heart to tell him  It's fin fungus. He'll be floating upside-down by morning."
Bender, Am I a robot?
Fry," Oh, good."
Bender, Phew!
Zoidberg," That's why I love Earth! You can do what you want, and no one makes you feel guilty because no one cares."
Fry," Okay, hurry. Let's get it over with. I can record Leela's birthday card while we're in there."
Fry, Well I'm feelin' lucky! Uh ... I'm ready to go back now.
Zoidberg, Stop!
Bender, It's crooked!
Farnsworth, I had a few beers but I'm cool to drive.
Fry," Oh, Leela!"
Amy," Leela, are you crazy? We became fugitives and jail-breakers to stop him."
Amy, Abraca-duh! Just ask the Professor. He lives in the Emerald Laboratory down Martin Luther King Boulevard.
Amy, Second.
Fry, Still a little nervous?
Hermes, No!
Amy, There 'e is!
Fry, Any word from Leela?
Fry, So's a peacock but you don't eat it until it's cooked. This has to be perfect. I want you to hear exactly what I hear when I think about you.
Bender, You're with me now. This is the maximum level of being with me!
Fry, Yeah. But I don't guess anything I could do will ever make you feel the same way about me that I do about you.
Hermes," You do a nice hand job, Zoidberg. Tell me, If I could find an undamaged body, could you recapitate me?"
Fry, Sure!
Leela," Let's see. We've got our malt, our hops. We just need a big disposable tub to mix it in."
Leela, With friends like you guys--
Bender, Come to papa!
Leela," Oh, Lord, he's made of wood! What now, Bender?"
Farnsworth," So, Bender, tell us about this new girlfriend of yours."
Bender, Yes! I'm the greatest! The greatest!
Leela," Oh, no! My parents are leaving. I've gotta go change back into street-Leela."
Leela, Hurry! The escape pods should be just ahead!
Leela," How is Lynn, by the way?"
Bender," Okay, we finished digging this shallow grave."
Fry, Non-creative? Ha! I'll have you know I bedazzle my own underpants.
Hermes," Excuse me, but we're guests on your planet. Speak English!"
Bender, But the crowd loves me.
Bender," I'm half crazy, All for the love of you, It won't be a stylish marriage,"
Amy, Uh-oh. 'E must be overheating again.
Farnsworth, He's good all right. But he's no Clem Johnson. And Johnson played back in the days when steroid injections were mandatory.
Leela, Ah! Ow! Oh!
Bender," Green Bluebird, this is Mr. Fabulous. We are go for cheesing it."
Leela," Adlai, I was thinking, since we're both orphans, maybe we should adopt a child."
Leela," Keep laughing, Fnog! Ready, Bender?"
Leela," But she saved all our lives. Without her, we're light enough to get away."
Farnsworth, Good thing I had this net installed for catching giraffes.
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. I'm still technically alive. Yes! But I need to you to dispose of this crazy-ass experiment that almost killed me. You'll have to throw it into the sun itself. For only the thermo-nuclear inferno of the sun has enough energy to ensure its total destruction."
Fry, Pretty boy.
Farnsworth," Amy, why don't you give his body a going over with the cleaning pick?"
Leela," Um, alright."
Amy, Only weirdos and mutants join third parties.
Bender, Here you go.
Bender," What is the world coming to? That Fry's a sicko poivert, I tell you. Dating a robot! It's an atrosmacy!"
Fry," Well, uh, we'll be leaving now. If you'll just sign this form saying you received the atom."
Bender, Then along came Bender.
Fry, And remember when Mayor Giuliani cracked down on jaywalking?
Amy, This is deodorant.
Zoidberg," Hey, don't cut that! I need that to speak!"
Fry, Let me go with you. It'll be just the two of us. We'll make a fire and play Uno.
Fry," Woo, yeah!"
Fry," No! Stop! Take my hands! (singing) You evil, metal dork!"
Leela," Comport yourself, Mr. Conrad! When we're at space, the Captain's word is law. I could marry you and Bender against your will if I wanted to."
Leela, Whoa!
Zoidberg, Of course! Why didn't I think of that!
Fry," Look, Leonard, we're light enough to keep the tapes! Isn't that great?"
Fry," That's it! This place is too dangerous. We gotta get you out of here! Everything's gonna be alright, Dad!"
Bender," Funny, funny stuff."
Fry, Look how ridiculous they look.
Fry, I don't wanna!
Fry, Whatcha eating?
Leela," Fry, I'm a professional athlete! So go ahead."
Hermes," Professor, stop! You're giving away personal information!"
Bender," I assure you, I barely know the meaning of the word ""labour""."
Fry, I wouldn't count on that.
Leela," Well ... i-it's hard to find shoes that fit me. So, anyway, who are you people? Haven't I seen you in some copyrighted movie?"
Farnsworth, That's not the point. Your temper is out of control. And to think I'd have never even known if it weren't for the lengthy and unsolicited tattling of Dr. Zoidberg.
Hermes," Well, we're bankrupt in six, five..."
Leela," Hey, I hear Fry. Boy, am I glad you're here."
Bender," Come on, you call yourselves chumps?"
Fry," Comet kaboomination in three, two—"
Hermes, Sign the paper!
Leela," I know. Amy, get the bottle."
Bender," Hey, chief, you screwed up. There's nothing in here."
Leela, My girls!
Amy," So, Fry, Atlanta was an American city in your time?"
Bender, Sounds like fun on the bun!
Farnsworth, Never!
Fry, N-- N-- N--
Leela, I'm not mopey. You shut up!
Fry," Yeah, well, they probably just copied us."
Hermes, What?
Bender," Whoa, Mittens!"
Fry," Oh, my God! His boneitis!"
Bender," Hey, look, the Robot Museum! You guys wanna learn about robot heritage?"
Fry, And Scruffy's buffet? How's that going?
Fry, Nice net.
Farnsworth," It seems to be working at only half-capacity, but I can fix it."
Leela, Look! A starling!
Leela," According to the script, you're supposed to prance out and tickle him with your fairy wand. Instead, I want you to prance out and kick his head off!"
Fry, What was that? A tar dolphin or a tar shark?
Fry, Bite my shiny metal hat.
Fry," Me, too."
Leela, What are you doing to my ship?
Amy," Oh, God, this is like one of those nightmares."
Amy, You're too picky.
Leela, Aw!
Bender, Let's just say he may not make it to The Last Supper. Hahahahahaha.
Bender," Hmm. I'm bettin' it all! Come on, baby needs a new pair of feet!"
Amy, I 'unno.
Bender," Hey, who's been messing with the radio? This isn't alternative rock, it's college rock!"
Farnsworth," Some sort, yes. In France it's called a guillotine."
Fry," I'll kill you too, buddy. I'll kill you too!"
Bender, I don't get it!
Fry, I think I saw a mermaid.
Leela, I'm sorry. My friend and I have to go and perform some mindless repetitive tasks.
Bender," Sure thing, pal."
Bender," Man, that smells great!"
Bender, Yeah! What are you chicken?
Zoidberg, You? The successor? Over my empty shell! The Professor will pick me. Only I have his lobster-like tenacity.
Fry, Hurry! The Golden Gate Bridge! Put the metal to the pedal to the other metal.
Leela, It's on fire!
Bender, Shut up. That's a good one.
Amy," Oh, my God! That was close!"
Fry," Ooh, nice cake. Sorry, I'm late."
Fry, Whoa!
Fry, Leela back yet?
Bender," Oh, come on!"
Fry, Boneitis? Pft! That's a funny name for a horrible disease.
Zoidberg, You didn't have to call attention to his speech impediment.
Bender," Man, I'm worried about him. But not enough to stop gambling for even a single second."
Zoidberg," My first mission. I'm so excited. And, after I dissect the Yeti's poison glands, we can stop maybe for ice cream on the way back? With sprinkles on?"
Zoidberg, So he's not perfect. You don't wanna end up old and lonely like Zoidberg! You were saying?
Fry, Whoa!
Leela," Whatever its beef is, our one mission now is to get that monument to Earth."
Fry, So where's the celebrity dating place?
Fry," Quite idiotic. But you don't need to be an idiot to see that you two belong together. And, Leela,I want what'll make you happy, not what'll make me happy."
Bender," Pardon me, brother. Care to donate to the Anti-Mugging-You Fund? Ow!"
Farnsworth," Look out, a solar flare!"
Leela," Then it wasn't space bandidos. Bender, lock down the ship. Don't let Flexo escape."
Bender," Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at! Wait. Why'd you stop eating, master?"
Farnsworth, I can't believe it. He won by a single vote.
Fry, I'm not a robot! I'm not a robot!
Fry, Will there be cake?
Zoidberg, Brilliant!
Bender, No. The cat shelter's on to me!
Fry," Hello, Colleen."
Amy, Wow! When I was a little girl on Mars I dreamed of being Miss Universe.
Fry," Jeez, doesn't that shock collar hurt?"
Leela," Um, sweetie? You see that giant quasar we're heading into? You might wanna scooch a few parsecs to the left."
Leela, Alcazar? Are you real? Or am I seeing single?
Bender," Ah, the moment seemed right. Call me old-fashioned but I like a dump to be as memorable as it is devastating."
Leela," We're probably gonna make it, but we might not."
Leela," OK, Mushu, it's feeding time! Oh, crud! He ate my suit."
Fry, What's wrong with it?
Fry," OK, but what are the Brain Slugs who control you gonna do for the working man?"
Fry," Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything."
Fry," Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm working on Seymour's doghouse."
Leela," Well, if that would work."
Fry," Aw, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, if we found your antenna could they still reattach it?"
Bender, Bender's innocent!
Bender, Up your face! Everybody do the Bender!
Zoidberg," We're rolling in three, two... What? We're already rolling?"
Leela, But—
Fry," Hey, guys."
Bender, Hold on a minute!
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. We have a mission to further the noble cause of intergalactic peace."
Zoidberg," I saw a frilly cake in here you would remember all your life. I know I will. Late at night it haunts me with its frosted beauty. Order the cake, damnit!"
Farnsworth, It's not always a burp. We still have one problem though  This robot will never meet emission standards.
Zoidberg, It's not a duffel bag. It's my apartment.
Amy, He's so polite.
Fry, Looks like this planet is next in line.
Bender, Better mascots than you have tried.
Fry, I had no idea the company would be sold. I was just an innocent suck-up. You've gotta believe me!
Zoidberg," Let's watch, shall we?"
Bender, Apparently not.
Fry," No, it's what makes you you."
Leela," Femputer, be reasonable. Sure men are annoying and they wreck up whatever planet they're in charge of, but most of these men are sorta my friends. They don't deserve to die."
Bender, Of course I'm not planning to steal that crown!
Bender," Helmut Spargle has a message for you. He says ""Ooh, I'm dead!"""
Farnsworth," Like fun it is, you glass-headed wallaby!"
Fry, Wow! You guys sell every kind of meat here except human!
Fry, Yay! My buddy's home! And his respect for women is back to normal.
Farnsworth, Then he can't stay here. He's a menace to every straight person in the company. Go satisfy your bend lust and don't you come back to work until you do.
Leela, You'll never get away with this.
Leela," Fry, night lasts two weeks on the moon."
Hermes," Then we have a tie. And in the event of a tie, the Professor, as the current CEO remains--"
Fry," OK, take it easy!"
Fry," Oh, sorry. Sign here."
Bender," Boy, what is the deal with the ocean? A tropical island, huh? Well, I've washed up on worse places. OK, first up, I'm gonna need to build a shelter. There. Well, I guess I'll go out for a while."
Fry, Somethin' is not right. I refuse to believe it. Rewind!
Leela," Fry, what are you doing?"
Fry, Over here. I wanna hold him.
Bender," Wow. We've sure got a lot in common, Beck. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet who transcends genres even as he re-invents them, just like you."
Amy," You're not so bad yourself, big boy."
Leela, There. We can make these into spears.
Bender," You know, Fry, I've often thought about becoming a Prime Minister."
Zoidberg," Captain, please, have some liquor. You robots need alcohol to function."
Leela, Or we could fly around it.
Farnsworth," We, by which I mean you, will have to rush him to his ancient homeworld which will shortly erupt in an orgy of invertebrate sex."
Leela," Okay, good. On three. One."
Leela," Fry, just pay me. I still owe 30 bucks on this uniform."
Leela,"  Fry, I came to talk to you."
Bender, More wine!
Zoidberg, Enough already!
Fry, This isn't the way Christmas is supposed to be.
Amy, I spent a semester in Africa harpooning giraffes. And giraffes are basically just land space whales.
Bender," You know it, and there's mini-quiches, too."
Zoidberg," Aw! Don't make me remember! So horrible, it was."
Leela, Hm. This thing I wear on my wrist says they're not poisonous.
Fry, The less fortunate get all the breaks!
Bender," We're whaling on the original were-car, which is you, you jerk."
Leela," Coilette, you she-devil! You really thought you could steal those diamonds from me and Congo Jack?"
Zoidberg, Huh? I thought it was mine!
Farnsworth, Get out there!
Fry, This can't be happening.
Bender," Yes, everyone do the same thing!"
Fry," Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda back where I used to work, Panucci's Pizza. It's the price of a cheese pizza and a large soda--"
Farnsworth, Could it possibly be? Are the old legends true? It is! It's the fabled lost city of Atlanta!
Fry," That's right, honey! Whatever you say."
Bender, You ugly nerd! Enjoy a nice guggenheim swirley. Let this beatin' be a lesson about never attacking those more handsome than oneself.
Leela," Thanks, guys. But let's be realistic. We all know any TV show that's even slightly good gets cancelled. Sometimes, two or three times."
Bender, Suck in that gut! You wanna be spayed?
Bender," Oh, it's awful, Kwanzaabot. Everyone hates me."
Amy," The show looks so cute. Kids'll love it! And it looks so cruddy, their ironic hipster parents will love it."
Farnsworth," Let's get this gargoyle hunt on the road. Driving gloves, driving goggles, driving thong. There!"
Leela," What are you, a whining machine? lf you want to worry about something, worry about the Yetis."
Farnsworth," Perhaps, for a few minutes. It's dolomite, baby!"
Fry, All I know is I've got a ghost that needs busting.
Amy, You're breaking up with me?
Fry, Kareem's got the sky hook but Philip J. Fry's got the space hook!
Fry, OK!
Amy, It wasn't supposed to do any of those things.
Farnsworth," You know, I'm not quite sure. Oh, dear me!"
Amy, Shame on—
Leela," Oh, now look. It's obvious you miss being Fry's roommate. But there's got to be a better way to deal with this."
Leela," Listen, I'm scared too. But I'm more scared of disappointing myself."
Fry, Not till I get my 600 quatloos!
Fry," Oh, yeah? Well, I've got news for ya. I'm not stayin' like this. You're the Doctor!"
Leela, Why did you bring us here?
Leela, Buckle your sphincters.
Fry," So are walnuts and they're delicious. I'll miss you, Mr. Peppy. But you'll be happier here. So... Go on. Go. Goodbye, Mr. Peppy. Come on, man. Don't do this. Go on now. I mean it. Don't make this any harder than it has to be. It's time to let go! Ow! Thanks, Leela. He just needed a little extra push."
Bender, Mind if I tag along? I gotta bring my ass in for servicing. The recall notice says it could burst into flames in a low-speed collision.
Bender, Well ... 'tis the season!
Leela, I'd love to chip in but Bender stole my wallet.
Bender," Just like inside me, I've got the heart of a human. What?"
Bender," Here you are, my lad. Bring the lady's car around in the finest way possible."
Bender, Huh? Wha? You! What the hell are you doing here?
Amy, Yay! I'm finally done with school. How's the job market?
Fry, This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has a vampire and an explosion!
Fry, Hmm. I remember the square-dancing stomachs. Although that might have been a Mylanta commercial. Wait! The brains! I do remember! But no one else does. They said I was crazy.
Amy, So what happened to Bender?
Bender, I'm 40% scrap metal.
Fry, That jerk! No one hoots at my captain unless they're prepared to take it to the next level!
Farnsworth," Okay, everyone, into the fountain."
Farnsworth," It's a sunny little doomed planet, inhabited by a number of frisky little doomed animals."
Farnsworth," Bad news, me. I failed to take into account the cerebral immune response."
Farnsworth," But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver."
Fry, Wow! It's incredible.
Bender, No. It will take a lot more money than that to make a girl like you happy.
Bender," Uh, I knew that. What I'm actually outraged by is your choice of wine. Really, it's the steward's fault."
Leela, That oughta keep those dopes occupied. I can guard the real box in peace now that no one's curious about it.
Farnsworth, Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Fry," Yee-haw! Bow before your master, puny mortals! Giddy-up!"
Fry, Yeah!
Fry," Professor, no! Don't do it!"
Bender, Then what are those?
Leela, My girls are back!
Fry, I can eat. And fertilise.
Leela, You pig. Stop stuffing your craw and save us.
Hermes, You dumb stumps. Don't you realize you're being scammed?
Leela, Hey! He stole my ring!
Leela, OK. I'll try. Go away!
Leela," You didn't train Destructor. You're just controlling him like a puppet. I mean, cheating in a fake fight. That's low!"
Farnsworth," Oh, Lord! We'll have to endure the horrible music of the Big Bopper and then the terrible tragedy of his death."
Bender," Bite my red-hot glowing ass. Wait a minute. Red-hot glowing ass? I'll be right back! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Aw, yeah!"
Bender," This is quite a shock. On the other hand, it's not surprising in the least. After all, I've been bending since the day I was built."
Fry," Oh, wait, it hasn't started yet. OK, it's about to start."
Fry, Huh? Bigfoot? You taught yourself English?
Farnsworth, Not lifeless enough! Set up my shack so that I can kick you out of it!
Leela," That's great, really, but he's just not what I'm looking for."
Farnsworth," Why, yes! One week longer to be exact."
Hermes," You know what? I will help you, but only to prove I'm not just a paper-pushing file-jockey."
Bender," Oh, God. We're all gonna die in agony."
Bender, Just as well; I think he comes from a dimension that's big on musical theatre.
Leela, Yeah. It's probably only got a Howard Johnson's.
Amy," Well, whatever. Hey, listen, as long as we're not seeing each other, you mind if I ask someone else out for Valentine's Day?"
Bender, Daddy's tired. Let's just have another dog-pile on Fry.
Leela, That's Amy's sweatshirt!
Leela, So how are you gonna lug all those gifts to Mom's factory?
Bender, It's salt with water in it if that's what you mean.
Fry, She's so great. I feel like I can almost remember the magical thing I did to make her love me. But I guess I never will.
Zoidberg, I'm so into you!
Farnsworth, They were lost in the Bermuda Tetrahedron!
Farnsworth, Oh!
Bender," And now, technology shall taste the lash of the hickory switch!"
Bender," Wooh, I've got fruit boobs!"
Zoidberg," What, do I smell or something?"
Fry, Thank God I got you off that dangerous army base.
Fry," OK, I gotta break down that gate, beat up those three guards, steal that chopper and rescue Bender."
Bender," Eh, no need to worry. I don't have an addictive personality."
Bender, This time I miss Nibbler and I'm feeling nosy and opinionated.
Bender," That's it, I'm saying it! ""A"" is for--"
Leela, Was there anything in there that might have been a gift for me?
Bender, Who's in charge of this dump?
Hermes," Uh, what does piano wire count as?"
Fry," That is low, Bender.  Even by your standards."
Fry, Wow! Way to tell that guy off. Now what's your secret escape plan?
Leela, It's nice.
Fry," Look! There's been a terrible mistake. I'm a human being. See? I'm all squishy and flabby. Also, I complain a lot."
Fry, Leela! I've been so worried. Are you a bonehead?
Hermes, That's because you're not me.
Amy, OK. Does it hurt when I go like this?
Farnsworth," Start the ship, Leela. Let's just steal the damn radar dish and get back to our own time."
Leela," Mom, Dad, Grandma, this is where I work."
Fry, What's happening?
Bender," Five bucks an autograph, 200 fans. Add a one and two zeros in front of that and we got ourselves a wad!"
Fry, He'd come after me!
Bender," You know, a coward."
Amy, She left a while ago. She said some idiot were taking her to lunch for her birthday.
Leela, Dear Captain's Diary  I may not have found love on this mission but I did find a cute little companion who excretes starship fuel. And that's just as good.
Bender," Happy Robanukah, everyone! Coming up next, more thoughtful, interfaith hijinx!"
Bender," Alright, Koenig, I've wanted to do this for years!"
Bender," Fine, I'll go already. Y'know, sometimes I wish your real parents were still alive. Not often, though."
Fry, Wait a second. That's my name! Good Lord. He ditched his goofy name and stole mine!
Hermes, Sweet ghost of Babylon.
Fry, Things like me or... Things like this badminton racket?
Fry, Yeah! We're slowing down!
Leela, No! You didn't! You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station and pocketed our money!
Bender, I can't run anymore. I'll have to skip.
Fry," Aw, shucks, Colonel."
Fry," Well, my lead pipe hurts a little."
Leela," Oh, hell."
Leela, Please stop.
Fry, Who?
Leela," Yes, we will. This sewer goes right under Planet Express, and it's 9pm!"
Bender," I can't. You should have called my cousin, Turner."
Fry, You have much to teach us.
Bender, Wait. Let me come with you.
Fry, No.
Amy," No, Bender! The other way."
Amy, Why?
Farnsworth," Yes! It kills its prey by sucking out the skeleton, leaving nothing but a puddle of flesh."
Leela," Oh, they're all so adorable."
Leela, It feels great to be back at the wheel after two long years.
Bender, The what now?
Amy, These costumes are gonna make it hard to go to the bathroom.
Fry, Why would you hold up the same bank twice?
Bender," In order to fix your leaky roof, I'll need to spend two or three hours down here in the wine cellar."
Fry," It's tempting, but, well, I am already kinda settled in here."
Fry," Where am I, anyway?"
Fry, That will show them our peaceful intentions.
Bender," Me? I, uh cast a spell of darkness. Pretty imaginative, huh?"
Amy, Humidifier.
Bender," In a closet? Oh, humans!"
Leela, It says he was mummified in ceremonial vestments.
Farnsworth, Great news everyone. You'll be delivering a package to Chapek 9. A world where humans are killed on sight!
Fry," Ladies and gentlemen, this is the plane's president speaking."
Leela," I'm telling you, it spoke to me. Come on, little Poppler, say ""mama""."
Leela, We're in luck. This must have been the cabin of a soup bootlegger back in the days of soup prohibition.
Leela, Really? It loves us that much? Fire Diamondium cannon!
Amy," If you wanna save this company, you should listen to a woman's idea for once."
Bender," Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train arriving on track one."
Farnsworth," Of course not, stupid! I mean, that flying machine is as aerodynamic as a sofa. How could it possibly get off the ground?"
Fry, I guess I can't.
Amy, No way!
Bender," Oh, God!"
Bender," Alright, but hands off the minibar."
Bender, A thousand and one pesos!
Bender," Fry, look who I found! It's Petunia, your dream girl!"
Farnsworth," Well it's a spaceship, so I'd say anywhere between zero and one."
Bender, Really?
Bender, Whoa! You look a lot better than you used to for some reason.
Fry," No. I can throw up on a stripper anytime. Tonight, I wanna not throw up. On you."
Amy, Ready to hoist?
Bender, I didn't kill him. Professor?
Bender, Don't hurt me! I'll betray anyone!
Fry," Time to re-educate you dunce-bags. We'll start with US presidents. This was our first president, George Washington. Let's review. Who was our first president?"
Leela, Hurry up Fry.
Amy, Woohoo!
Bender, Where'd you get an idiotic idea like that?
Zoidberg, Bravo!
Fry, I love ice fishing.
Leela," That idiot! It wasn't set for 25 minutes, it was set for 52 seconds."
Leela, One hundred kilometers! Two hundred!
Hermes, Why can't they go today?
Amy, It means unity.
Farnsworth, Yay!
Zoidberg, That was uncanny.
Zoidberg, My whole life I worked on that act. And they hated it.
Fry, Make it two. And a glass of all your water.
Leela, I don't know what came over me. I killed one person on impulse. Then I had to kill another. And another.
Fry," Colleen? Wait a second, are you and Yivo..."
Fry," Bender?! Bender! It's me, Fry!"
Bender, I am Bender. Please insert girder.
Leela," You did it, Fry!"
Farnsworth," Dear Lord, they're back!"
Leela, That's so sad. I didn't even know monkeys could cry.
Farnsworth, The owner of the company pressured me to create a bigger sportier robot.
Farnsworth," Of course, there's a catch."
Bender, They did? Aw! So that's why this was unguarded.
Fry, We did it!
Bender," Alright, I am. But I don't want the others to know. If I don't come back, just say I died robbing some old man."
Fry," No, sir. Not on my mustache's watch."
Fry, Ew!
Fry, There!
Leela," Huh? Oh, sure. Knock yourself out."
Bender, Check my messages. A flashing light means somebody called.
Leela," Zoidberg said some dumb stuff but he's a nice guy, really. It's just that Fry's been telling him what to say and Fry's a ... do you have idiots on your planet?"
Fry," Oh, alright. How 'bout this? What if I never fell into that freezer-doodle and came to the future-jiggy?"
Fry," Uh, wait, Bender's my roommate. He could be back any second."
Farnsworth," Our paths first crossed when I was a researcher at Mom's Friendly Robot Company. The moment our eyes met we knew we'd be going at it like woodchucks. She was my first love -- or at least the earliest one I can still remember. But then, 70 years ago today..."
Bender," Hey, there you are! ... Oh, wait, that's Fry before he goes to the future. I'm waiting for the one who comes back from the future. Geesh this is confusing, and I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing. Offf. That cheap beer really goes right through you. For the first time ever, I gotta use the bathroom, but if I leave, I might miss Fry. Ohhhh unless ...."
Hermes," What's happened to you, mon? I thought you liked beer an' knock-knock jokes."
Leela, Come on. You've got to come out of your chest sometime. Would you do it for a Bender snack?
Bender, Well why aren't you fixing the boiler?
Bender," Please, please let me come with you. I can make myself taller."
Leela, My God! Saint James was a robot!
Zoidberg, Bupkis!
Leela," Please, Professor. Give us our jobs back. We deserve another chance."
Hermes, It's not supposed to be funny. It's a business meetin'.
Hermes," Strange. You haven't acted this suspicious since I found those ""ape bones"" in the basement."
Zoidberg, Her caviar is on your neck!
Fry," Alright, bird, you thought you could beat me in a game of wits. But you just met your equal."
Fry," Mr. Shore, I loved you in Bio-Dome. You sure caused some trouble in that bubble!"
Bender," I found it lying in the street, like all the food I cook. Dig in, everyone."
Farnsworth," I invented it, didn't I? You wouldn't ask Thomas Edison whether he knew how to use a sexmatron."
Farnsworth, No one gives my boy that option!
Bender," You, sir, have defaced a national treasure! I demand you restore my buttocks to their former glory."
Leela," You, Fry. Bender, while you still have your giant brain, please... Tell me  If Fry an' I ended up together—"
Leela," Fry, I don't need a diamond. You've given me the most beautiful rainbow I've ever seen! All the colours of the spectrum!"
Fry," Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested in. Uh, no need to pack pants, people. Let's roll!"
Bender," Aye, aye, lady."
Bender," Come on, where is it?"
Amy," Leela blackmailed us all into eating healthy, organic food."
Fry, Oh! Now I'm too nervous.
Amy," I mean, unless it would make you feel bad, being a third wheel."
Bender, Now it's time for Santa to screw open his present!
Leela," Alcazar, I used to be a baby, it might have been me!"
Fry, I'll never see Leela again.
Fry, Surprise!
Zoidberg, Then suicide it is. Step into my office. I'll give you a nice Kervorking.
Bender, A few months in an insane asylum? I could do that standing on my head.
Fry, Hm.
Farnsworth, Of those poor sons of-- But that's not important. The important thing is I need a new crew. Anyone interested?
Amy," Please, Leela? Kif's like the sweetest guy who's ever liked me."
Fry," Leela, my love, will you marry—"
Bender, An' I left a trail of cigars!
Leela, Let me guess. Mom?
Leela, Quitting.
Leela," Why?! Why?! Also, what and how?!"
Hermes," No, that's just the Jamaican pride float."
Bender," I don't blame myself, I blame all of you."
Bender," Captain, I'm detecting life on the Spock-o-scope!"
Amy," Watch it, ya stumblebums! You're boopin' my betty!"
Bender," You could've saved the Robot, but instead you saved the Human. Do you think Human life is more precious than Robot life?"
Leela," Come on, Bender! Your grandmother could push harder than that!"
Bender, You saw it.
Bender," Please, I'm scared."
Farnsworth," Yes, there's no safer occupation than mining. Especially when you're perched on a snowball whipping through space at a million miles an hour. Safe!"
Amy, Then look at Nibbler!
Fry," Oh, uh, OK."
Bender," So, she's falling for Flexo, eh? I'd better seduce her a little more, just to be sure."
Fry, So I see!
Bender, Now for a dash of salt! Uh-oh!
Zoidberg," Alright, I'm coming."
Fry, El zilcho! I'm afraid we're boned.
Leela," You don't have to do this, Fry. Mr. Peppy just gave me a little love concussion."
Amy," Sorry, I'm super-allergic to cats. Professor Katz, would you mind."
Leela, Wake up? But I'm not--
Leela," Look, Alcazar--"
Leela," I'm worried about him too, Professor."
Fry, Bam!
Hermes, Let me give you my pager number.
Bender, Alcohol?
Bender, It's really bright in the past.
Farnsworth," Hmm, I could swear I've never seen that robot before either."
Farnsworth," Well, in regular fossilisation, flesh and bone turn to minerals. Realising that, it was a simple matter to reverse the process. I've already tested it by turning the toaster into a racoon."
Fry," Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only on TV and radio. And in magazines and movies and at ball games, on buses and milk cartons and T-shirts and bananas and written on the sky. But not in dreams. No, sir-ee!"
Bender," Yeah, uh, gimme the fried spaghetti dinner breakfast pocket for lunch an', uh, a big bucket o' mixed sodas."
Bender," From now on, you give me half the gross or I'll blow your cover."
Farnsworth, I do!
Leela," No, don't kill it! We have to..."
Farnsworth," For this highly controversial mission you'll be towing the Juan Valdez, an orbiting supertanker full of rich Columbian dark matter."
Farnsworth," What's going on here? According to my illegal key logging software, you've all been giving out personal information over the Internet. If Hermes were here, he'd fire you all."
Bender, His legend lives on.
Farnsworth," Oh, my! It's da Vinci's fabled lost invention. Even the scholars who wrote of this device had no idea what it was for. And now, at least, neither do I!"
Bender," Damn you, Fry and Lee-- --la!"
Fry," Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh!"
Leela, What the hell's a common cold?
Fry," Leela, you can stop winning now. We won!"
Fry, Bender? Are you crying?
Bender," Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I wouldn't worry about it."
Fry, And here he is trying to make a catch with an oven mitt.
Farnsworth," Well, I suppose it's for the best, considering the unbearable horrors you've endured. Let's never speak of it again."
Leela, Wait! Isn't today the parade? It's just a giant balloon!
Bender, Neat!
Farnsworth," This mission is incredibly dangerous. Someone's sure to be killed. Fry, Leela, Bender--"
Leela," I must say, Hermes, you've got a smoking-hot body."
Fry," OK, OK, don't worry. The love meister will take you under his wing."
Amy," Temperature? Woah! The magma P.I. is 10,000 degrees Selleck! Leela, I am collecting data. Can't you dump that somewhere else?"
Fry," So, what is Freedom Day? Sounds like some kind of feminine hygiene product."
Fry," Aww, thanks for believing in me."
Leela," Uh, Bender, I think Fry needs a moment alone."
Bender, I'm her favourite.
Leela, I've been thinking a lot about moving on with my life. And hearing the words Nibbler on the Roof has given me the kick in the pants I needed. It's time for me to leave and make a fresh start.
Fry," So, what's it like on planet Amazonia?"
Farnsworth, I'm your man.
Leela, Oh. I-I'll be out in a sec.
Zoidberg, I'm sorry but we couldn't remove it.
Zoidberg," Well, sure, but who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a ""death sphere""?"
Bender," At ease, buckos."
Fry," Also, my shoe that fell off."
Zoidberg, I can't spell anything with these cards.
Amy, Please!
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! The university is bringing me up on disciplinary charges. Wait, that's not good news at all."
Bender, Woo! I'm smart! I know how to spell aardvark. February is the shortest month. There's three-thousand-eighteen jelly beans in that jar.
Leela," Zoidberg, stop! We are too scared right now to enjoy the ceremony of your death!"
Leela," Oh, look! A cute little welcoming party."
Bender, Well they should have stopped making her about halfway through.
Hermes," You took his name? Oh, God, no! In several ways!"
Fry," Thank you, Nixon. Everyone everywhere, brace yourselves for the most shocking development in the history of the human race."
Bender, You call yourself divorced? You're making a mockery of one of our oldest institutions.
Bender, Am so!
Farnsworth, That's it! It's done! I can't believe it! My mind is boggling. The analysis of the note is printing out now.
Bender," Ah, beer! So many choices, and it makes so little difference."
Leela, Sure she did.
Fry," Look, could chocolate just let me finish?"
Farnsworth," Dear Lord, that's over 150 atmospheres of pressure."
Bender, You can't hit what you can't see!
Farnsworth, Well then good news! It's a suppository.
Zoidberg," As God is my witness, you can count on me. Well... See you tomorrow."
Fry," Or maybe, he never left at all! Wait a minute. You're Bender."
Farnsworth," Oh, my! Did it put you young whippersnappers in your place?"
Farnsworth," No. Now, I've often said ""good news"" when sending you on a mission of extreme danger. So when I say this anomaly is dangerous, you can imagine how dangerous I really think it is."
Bender, I am Bender. Please insert girder.
Fry," OK, crow, prepare to be scared. And then, ""honk, honk,"" the car honked its own horn!"
Leela," They're only a foot high, Professor."
Hermes," You aren't, are you?"
Leela," Hubert J. Farnsworth was born April 9th 2851 in New New York's nerdiest slum, Hell's Laboratory. A precocious child, young Hubert learned to read while he was still in diapers -- at age 8. And before long he blossomed into a greasy teenager."
Farnsworth, Perhaps it's your outlook that needs a good bend. A 90-degree bend to a place where happiness is perpendicular to wonderment.
Hermes," Professor, have you gone mad?!"
Bender, Seems like a good place to ditch some evidence. Flexo?!  What are you doin' in a hazardous wastebin?
Fry," Leela, header!"
Leela, Blech!
Leela," Sounds like your kinda place, Fry. Wanna go?"
Leela, Just ask the question.
Fry, I think they look cool.
Zoidberg, I call entirely.
Fry, A delivery?
Fry," What goes down, must back up!"
Fry, Faster! Faster!
Bender, Each more identical than the last!
Amy," Yeah! One bowl of Jell-O knuckles, please."
Bender," Hmm. The thought of stealing anything fills Superking with disgust. But if it must be so, then let a museum heist be pulled!"
Zoidberg, What's this? Two meals in one week?
Bender," Oh, Elzar, you'll never guess what's happened?"
Leela," Who's there? Hermes, is this one o' your zany practical jokes?"
Bender, The Donbot?! The vicious Robot gangster?! I'd better use my special Robot vision to see what's inside. It looks like a pair of clamps!
Zoidberg, Alright.
Fry," Ah, so the real gift Spargle gave you was confidence. The confidence to be your best."
Bender, I don't need your charity. Target Robot 1-X and fire!
Hermes, What are you hacking off? Is it my torso? It is! My precious torso!
Leela," Forget it, Zookeeper! You're going into captivity."
Bender, Follow that guy. There's an extra hundred in it for you if you follow him so close that you run him over.
Bender, Woo! We're the greatest! Mostly me!
Amy," Shmezzus, it's hot! Why'd I have to invent that awful device?"
Leela, Animals eat other animals. It's nature.
Zoidberg, Shotgun!
Amy, Not precious ambergris!
Fry," Ooh. ""Reasons unknown."" Now that's the sort of hook that grabs the attention of me, the viewer."
Fry, I'm busy with my space experiment. I can't devote precious brainpower to blowing my nose.
Farnsworth, I'll admit to a polite interest.
Hermes," Woohoo! Alright! Well done, Professor. Okay. Back to work, everyone."
Hermes, Let's get the pizza out of here.
Farnsworth, Can you put that in the form of a question?
Farnsworth," Well there's no sense fretting. Good Lord, you're ugly! The fact is your nose is gone and we'll never find out who did it or why."
Fry, I don't trust that McZongo. Maybe I should go keep an eye on Mr. Peppy.
Zoidberg, These X-ray specs will really take the guesswork out of surgery. No more chopping blindly in the goop.
Fry, Say what?
Fry, Although the snu-snu part's gonna be pretty good.
Bender, Ooh! Cushion-y! And a minibar!
Bender," Aw, no! A strike? Now I'll never get to bend anything. Oh, woe is Bender."
Farnsworth, I don't want to live on this planet anymore.
Fry," Oh, my God! It's out of ice! Like some outer space Motel 6!"
Fry," Mom, Yancy's trying to steal my clover."
Leela, Bender! Quit destroying the universe!
Leela, Let's do it again sometime.
Fry, So my copy lives twelve years before Bender murdered him?
Leela, Mmm. The ingredients are cooked. And they've picked up some of your natural robot flavourings. Time to add the yeast.
Hermes, You're all fired.
Bender, The old Bender's gone. He won't trouble you anymore.
Farnsworth, I've gathered you all here in the accusing parlour because one of you is a miniature ship wrecker.
Fry, It's not fair. I've loved Leela since the day I came to the future. Did I show you the macaroni valentine I made for her?
Farnsworth, Finally! Any more ridiculous ideas?
Farnsworth," It's true, Saint James really was a robot."
Fry, But you live in a gingerbread house.
Bender, Oh.
Bender, Why won't anyone help me?
Bender," Aw, no! These broads are s'posed to wrestle for six and a half weeks! But there's only enough petroleum oil for four and a half weeks!"
Leela," Oh, no! He's disabled the steering. We're gonna crash!"
Bender," Oh, yeah? Then how come when I was a kid, I had a whole sticker book of them? Answer that with your precious logic."
Leela, What's this spice for?
Fry, Welshie!
Leela, We couldn't disarm the bomb so we reset the word that triggers it.
Leela, But we have no choice. Rednecks insulted us.
Hermes, Oy!
Leela, So thirsty.  Why couldn't a water fountain have fallen on me?
Leela," Leave him alone. It's not his fault that he's an unstoppable killing machine. Is it, snoogums?"
Hermes, Didn't we used to be a delivery company?
Fry," You didn't like Country Bear Jamboree either, Leela. There's no pleasing you."
Fry, You too!
Leela, As long as it's not about my eye.
Bender," You know the secret of traditional robot cooking? Start with a good, high-quality oil ... then eat it. So what's this big score anyway?"
Farnsworth, 12 years ago I began the cloning process by removing some skin cells from one of the shapelier growths on my back.
Leela, It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution.
Leela, Am I the only one who thinks this is all a sham?
Bender," Come on, it's just like making love. Y'know  Left, down, rotate 62 degrees, engage rotor."
Zoidberg," But, friends—"
Leela," This is more important than that marble-eating contest, Fry! It's about pride. Let me tell you a story from my childhood."
Bender, Hot-cocoa break.
Bender, What's... What's happening?
Fry, I don't know. Do refrigerators still come in cardboard boxes?
Farnsworth," We seem to be lurching forward randomly in time, like a needle skipping on a record player."
Zoidberg, I help those who help themselves.
Farnsworth, This is my universal auto-translator!
Leela, Thank you. 
Leela," Should we really be celebrating? I mean, what if the second garbage ball returns to Earth like the first one did?"
Farnsworth, The age-restoring microbes are ready. Everyone into the bacterial spew chamber.
Leela," No, it's not!  There's precious life right here in this scum puddle. "
Leela, I mourn his loss. But what matters now is protecting Earth from that fruit armada.
Farnsworth," Ah, there is it. The Tempus Nebula. Take a whiff through the Smellescope."
Leela, ...maybe a snappy dresser.
Bender," Yeah, you are, you stole my body! Fry, Leela, you gotta help me!"
Farnsworth, I'm beginning to think there'll be no forced mating at all.
Bender, At least I'll always have her bracelet! What do you think it's worth?
Farnsworth, Good Lord! He doesn't know about Santa Claus.
Bender," Oh, I guess I am a cannon."
Bender, We do suck.
Fry, Owww!
Bender," No, they fixed that 900 years ago."
Fry," I hear that. I spent most of my teen years loving my body. Course, it was tough love but-- Ooh!"
Farnsworth," Yes, I have."
Fry, Happy new year.
Bender," So, Nixon. Even if you miss your body, being a head's great too, right?"
Bender," Happy. Yeah, that's Bender. Always happy."
Leela, What? How can you tell?
Amy," Oh, no! I've got it too! My nose is all gunked up with blork!"
Leela," I'd leave you to rot in this paradise if only the ship weren't destroyed! The ship's fully functional, isn't it?"
Zoidberg," Goodnight, Hubert."
Farnsworth, What a well prepared virus culture. This will make a fine vaccine.
Fry, Deep space?
Farnsworth, My God! Look!
Farnsworth," Of course! Having no mouths our ears, they could only communicate through motions!"
Zoidberg, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Fry," Hear, hear!"
Bender," Yes, we have to work together. Not have this fight which I was definitely winning."
Fry, Hello? Anybody home?
Fry," Brothers and sisters, get your love beads. Can't journey to the centre of your mind without love beads!"
Leela," You know, I'm not sure. I guess I thought whales died when you harpooned them."
Zoidberg," Hermes, my friend! Let me cut off your umbilical cord. Oops."
Bender, Enough of this crap! I'm catching the next pimpmobile outta here! But before I go I have one thing to say. Bite my shiny metal--
Zoidberg, Clack.
Fry, So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct?
Fry, Plus the cream won't give you superpowers. You're a robot.
Leela, You did it!
Bender," Oh, my God! Oh, my God! It's Elzar, the TV chef! Oh, kill me now, people!"
Leela, Well if the oxygen holds out we might live long enough to starve to death.
Bender," I don't even know what we do. Nah, just kidding! What are, like, a bus or something?"
Bender," Stay away from our women! You got metal fever, boy! Metal fever!"
Fry," Hey, now that you're in the future, you can go live in an actual bio-dome!"
Farnsworth, Everyone suit up. We're off to the most romantic city on Earth!
Leela," Hey, look! The disgusting little men are starting to sing."
Fry," Bender, I think you might be playing too much Dungeons & Dragons."
Farnsworth," Yes, I'd like to meet this Moose. But, in the meantime, I have good news. I may have solved our age problem."
Bender," No. It's called ""parenting"". Come on, dumplings. We've got 12 government stipends to collect."
Bender, Hey!
Amy, They don't leave much to the imagination.
Farnsworth," Then it's settled. Finally, a world in which I'm happy to raise my son!"
Farnsworth, Cha-ching!
Bender," Come on, let's deal. You'll have plenty of time to talk when you're poor."
Fry," Yes, I'll show you out."
Bender," Nailed you, buddy!"
Fry, Right. You gonna finish that roll?
Bender," Fry, if you don't take this offer right now I will lose all respect for you and punch you."
Hermes," That's the store, Professor."
Farnsworth, It's...my...new...pager.
Fry, Bender's not involved. Leela ... I love you.
Fry," That's weird. It's another Cyclops, only this one has five eyes."
Fry," Eh, it wouldn't be the same. I want my nose. I don't want to have to teach a new one how to shoot milk when I laugh."
Bender," So this is a human body, huh? Neat! Hey, my antenna's gone. No, it just moved. I'm not getting good reception on it though. Maybe if I wiggle it around a little."
Hermes, Barbados Slim! What are you doing here? Last time I heard you were in Barbados.
Leela, My only outlet was Arcturan Kung Fu.
Bender,   Heh heh heh! Oooh!
Fry, I don't have it! Nibbler heat-blasted it off my butt.
Fry, Let my happy smile warm your hearts--
Fry," No, I can't afford them. Being poor sucks. What kind of world is this where they advertise things not everybody can afford?"
Bender, Wake up already! I'm about to get down and funky with this ladybot. And I'd appreciate it if as many people as possible could know about it. Now can we get some privacy?
Fry," Hey, Leela, look who's the super-stud!"
Bender," Aw, New New York City! Woooo! Woooo! Don' worry about it! Do the robot, baby!"
Bender," Says the only human whose opinion I even remotely respect. Inspector 5, the best inspector a kid could want. The day I was built, he looked me over, probably with tears of pride in his eyes, and proclaimed to all the world, by means of this scrap of paper, that I was perfect and infallible in every way!"
Bender," Aw, yeah!"
Fry, I'm here to kick your ass.
Bender, Quick! In there!
Bender, What? Who said anything about me secretly wanting to be a folk singer? How ridiculous.
Fry," Uh, show him in."
Bender," Not so fast, Nixon! Are you familiar with audio tape?"
Fry," Tough break, Amy. Are you and Kif getting divorced?"
Leela, Good?
Zoidberg," You know, Fry, you could join a third party, maybe."
Hermes, We're talking about lots of stuff.
Fry," Well, what about Leela? Is there any hope things could still work out between us?"
Bender, Alright.
Farnsworth," There's one way, and only one way, to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain!"
Bender," I'm back, idiots!"
Bender," Hey, there's my little space heater."
Fry," Don't go, Leela, please. You an' me... We were supposed to..."
Fry," Bender, enough! Leave me alone!"
Zoidberg, But the sign said there was a mint in the box.
Leela, Vacation?
Bender," 500 real dollars? That's an outrage! Professor, I'll take care of that waste for $499 and 100 cents."
Amy," Not cool, bro! Our genders are all reversed!"
Farnsworth, Oh? Then you won't have any problem exterminating this owl.
Farnsworth," Actually, quite dangerous indeed."
Farnsworth," Hear, hear!"
Bender," Well there's always hope. C'mon, we gotta go fix the plasma fusion boiler."
Fry," Yeah, a barbecue! I'll wear my hilarious apron."
Zoidberg," Then you've got to go to them and work this song-and-dance stuff out. Maybe have them cook me nice dinner. No scallions. I hate them. (To an intercom ) Amy, cancel my appointments."
Bender, Why two? Oh!
Hermes, I just need some beeswax to make Kwanzaa candles.
Fry," No, thanks. I make my own."
Leela, We can't outrun it forever.
Farnsworth," Oh, dear! I really ought to do something. But I am already in my pyjamas."
Amy, Wha?
Bender," Hey, buddy, heard you needed cheering up! Well, old Bender'll make you laugh. Look at me, look! Oh, man, I gotta work on my act!"
Amy," Shmeesh, shmill out, shmeverybody. It's a wormhole hole."
Hermes," Um, maybe. But, whatever we are, I'm the leader of it."
Fry," Please, Bender. If everything is a chess game for you, you must know how to help me."
Fry, Tough call.
Fry," Thanks, Colleen. And listen, I'm sorry I got jealous before. I'm just happy to be here with you."
Amy," But my doctoral exam is in ten minutes! On Mars! Eww! Kif, did you yack on the floor?"
Farnsworth," Uh ... that we should all take TV a little less seriously. And more importantly, turn it off once in a while."
Fry," I had no choice; I was about to not exist. I could feel myself fading away, like Greg Kinnear."
Zoidberg, But won't that turn our ship into a piece of junk?
Bender, I'll get it with my trusty foot cups  Stompy and Smashy.
Amy, We've gotta get the Emperor out of your body before they kill you!
Fry, You!
Fry, I was in the hospital two weeks. No one visited me.
Fry, But don't you see? Fear has brought us together. That's the magic of Xmas!
Leela," Fry, please. That's sweet but I'd rather not even dignify them with an ass-whooping!"
Hermes, The grade 19's!
Leela, There's no such thing.
Farnsworth," Yes, ordinary water. Laced with nothing more than a few spoonfuls of LSD."
Bender," Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't have lasted one pitch in the old Robot Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there was a blern hitting machine!"
Leela, Your dad? Nixon?
Fry," I'm doing my job, there's Amy; I spend a few hours selecting a candy from the machine, there's Amy; I wake up the morning after sleeping with Amy, there's Amy!"
Fry, I can't drink that! The metal shavings make my throat bloody.
Leela," Uh, sorry, sir. I was still in attack mode. You know how testosterone is."
Bender," Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of other people's suffering. That's kind of a pick-me-up. Wow, that was great."
Fry, And action!
Amy, Yes it's ... great. A great miracle.
Bender," Yeah, well you should try not stinking at it."
Amy," Aw, don't feel bad. Major McZongo's an experienced hunter. He'll blow Mr. Peppy's head off as painlessly as possible."
Bender," No, thanks."
Fry," Oh, right. I was supposed to assign you a job. Let me just get your career chip installed. Hold out your palm. What are you scared of? It's just like getting your hand pierced."
Fry," Duh.  Hey, is it safe to talk while you're flying?"
Fry, Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?
Fry, It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just too macho.
Bender," Ow, my head! My precious head! Stupid can opener. You killed my father and now you've come back for me!"
Leela, Here you go. Hot off the nebula.
Leela, And we were in love.
Farnsworth, Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed? That's the last straw! You boys have been underfoot long enough!
Fry," We promise, Yivo. As far as we're concerned, you're the only universe in the world."
Leela, What the hell are you doing? You're getting a huge dose of radiation!
Fry, What's happening?
Bender, Yeah.
Fry, I don't even know what language you're speaking.
Leela, Robot...we be.
Leela," Bender, shut the hell up!"
Leela, Uh-oh. There seems to be some sort of electrical disturbance in the Coalsack Nebula.
Farnsworth, Never!
Bender, Idiots who need gifts for other idiots.
Fry, Yay!
Zoidberg," Using this magneto, I will now guide the keys up the thorax and out via the frontal face hole. That's the storage locker, the boat, the other boat, pay dirt!"
Bender, Flexo!
Leela, Hang on a second.
Bender," You vile racist! Haven't my people suffered enough? Now keep drilling for that petroleum oil, you selfish cowards! Although, then again, I guess any kind of oil would be just as-"
Fry, You're right. You're right. It was--
Bender," Hello, peasants."
Zoidberg, At least we've got food.
Leela, Bender's been down there too long. I'm going in after him.
Bender, And... Boned!
Bender, None of your business! Get off my back!
Fry, You saved us. Are you alright?
Farnsworth, Farnsworth?!! That's him! Arm yourselves!
Zoidberg," Is Bender still missing for a week? Where is he, already?"
Fry," Look, are you the original were-car or not?"
Farnsworth, No wonder we failed to stop the time skips. Diverting Chronitons is mathematically impossible. I knew I should have checked your show-boating Globetrotter algebra.
Bender, No. I'm gonna be a stalker!
Fry," Leela, about the wedding. I don't know what I did to make you love me, and I don't think I tricked you into it, but maybe I did. And if I did, I'm sorry."
Bender, OK Mmm! Shorts!
Bender, I just know these things. I've got what they call gaydar.
Zoidberg, A successor to the Professor?
Fry," One bucket o' double-friend, triple-salted, boneless sheep tots, please."
Amy," Yo, classmate. What you takin'?"
Bender," Look! Outdoor theatre! Let's get tickets. Oh, let's do!"
Farnsworth," Oh, good. Just let me put on my reading glasses. Why, Zoidberg, there's a lovely photo of you in here."
Bender, Hit it.
Hermes," Sweet Georgia Brown of Kingston Town! It's a tie!  Since no one lost, no one has to jump!"
Leela," Oh, Mommy! I found my true home!"
Bender," Well, here's your lousy Gemerald."
Leela, Aren't you upset at all? How would you feel if I flushed Fry down the toilet?
Fry," Please, it's important to me."
Bender, So much for a pleasant swim in vomit.
Bender, Who are you and why should I care?
Bender, I'm just an ex-con trying to go straight and get my kids back.
Hermes," Outta my way, wife! I wasn't cut out to be a bureaucrat anyway. I'm only anal 78.36% of the time. I'm not worthy to stamp a form, so I'll stamp the pavement with my flabby body."
Leela," Hi-yah! Your order may be famous for your martial arts, but I've never met a holy man I couldn't clobber."
Fry," You deserve it. I mean, nobody ever stops to tell you what a great captain you are."
Fry," Oh, boy."
Fry, It was called ... let me think. It was really famous -- Ruth Gordon had one. The wheel!
Bender," I mean a good calculator. Minus the food, the bunny rabbit wallpaper-- I'm getting 100 bucks a kid and they're costing me 110!"
Farnsworth," News, everyone! Today you're going to Osiris 4 to deliver this enormous sandstone block."
Leela, Oh! What are these things?! Get away!
Fry, So? Give me your honest praise.
Bender, Evidently not.
Amy, We're all gonna die!
Fry," Bender, d'you mind? I'm roosting."
Leela, I say yes again.
Leela, There's no such thing as mutants. That's a ridiculous urban myth.
Bender," Wow! Until now, I thought giant cubes were exciting."
Bender, I'm sleepwalking.
Farnsworth," Rodger that, activate Safety Spheres! Also mine has air conditioning."
Hermes, Hey.
Fry, Ray-blocking power!
Bender, That's crazy!
Farnsworth, Not necessarily. For the dog may yet survive.
Fry," Oh-ho, you'd like it if I went to sleep, wouldn't you?"
Fry, I think the view's perfect already!
Leela," So that's our proposal napkin, Mr. President. We have just enough people and ships to mount a ragtag attack."
Bender, Hey. What the--?
Fry," Delivery boy Philip J. Fry, reporting for duty."
Hermes, No. I'm Santa Claus.
Bender, Ooh! This is it! Turn me up!
Leela, I've been training with Hank Aaron.
Amy, Lassie is on display in the Louvre.
Fry," I am so, so sorry for what I did.  And I know I can never make it up to you."
Farnsworth, Their gravity might just divert the Chronitons to the empty side of the universe.
Fry, Religion? Is this another scam to get free yarmulkes?
Fry," Whoa, whoa, girl. I thought you were talking about one of those motels where the bed is shaped like stuff."
Hermes," Please welcome our new chief executive officer, That Guy."
Leela, Baby! Ow!
Fry, Hooray!
Leela, How many times do I have to tell other people? I'm not obsessed!
Farnsworth, Very well.
Leela, Huzzah!
Fry, She seems a little old for me.
Bender, And you are outta here!
Bender," Eh, foreign aggressors. Vhat's up?"
Bender," Alright, show's over. No refunds. You heard the robot. Get out!"
Amy," Look, there's a cave-like hole in that mountain. It might be a cave."
Bender," Hello, baby! Huh? Hey, what's going on here? And why are you kissing my dashing cousin instead of me?"
Leela," Yay, salad!"
Farnsworth, Damned she-fossil!
Farnsworth, That should do it.
Leela," I should have revealed I've been deafened by Bender, The shame, The shame, But I feared you'd stop writing this musical splendour, Deception's the curse of my whimsical gender, He gave me mechanical ears, Effective though just a bit garish, In return without shedding a tear, I agreed that I'd give him my hand--"
Hermes, What could you possibly have in common with this walking soup mix?
Bender, Don't talk like that. Tragic romances always have a happy ending.
Fry," and  Pop a Poppler in your mouth, When you come to Fishy Joe's, What they're made of is a mystery, Where they come from, no one knows, You can pick 'em, You can lick 'em, You can chew 'em, You can stick 'em, If you promise not to sue us, You can shove one up your nose."
Zoidberg," 'E doesn't have hypermalaria, you idiots! 'E has Yetiism. When 'e saved my life all those years ago, 'e was scratched by a Yeti!"
Leela, I hope this is the control stick!
Fry, I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check again.
Leela, Am I under arrest?
Zoidberg," And a rich, respected doctor with many surviving patients."
Bender," Yeah, yeah, amen. Listen, I'm one of those lazy homeless bums I've been hearing about. Could you point me to the free booze. Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!"
Zoidberg," Cheer up, friend. When we get home a high-quality prosthesis will have you looking good as new."
Leela, What was that?
Bender, A working cartridge unit? Wow! You guys went obsolete years ago!
Bender, But I come bearing Tri-ominos!
Leela, It's all so sad. What happened to our people?
Bender, Whoa! This is awesome!
Zoidberg," Well, everyone debone a bunk and get some shut-eye."
Farnsworth," Now here's the bomb I've prepared. Once you activate it, you'll have 25 minutes to get away."
Leela, Who are you?
Bender, Woo! I've never felt so energetic!
Leela," Okay, okay. Shut up, already."
Farnsworth," It used to be that every group in New New York wanted their own parade. Why, when I was a boy, we had a parade every day. Those were dark times."
Amy, Poor Mr. Chunks.  At least he died doing what he loved.
Fry," Leela, I'm through making fun of women. Now I want them to help me."
Fry, Turn around. We've gotta go back for Bender!
Leela, It's a hundred times more horrible than anything I could imagine.
Fry," But, Leela, we're no good."
Bender, Gotcha!
Fry," Mmm! Great pancakes, Leela."
Hermes," Was a substantial loss for the company. The blue slice represents the money we earned from shipping packages, while the green slice represents an $8 bank error in our favour."
Farnsworth, I'm sad now.
Fry," I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew up in this city. These are my people. What up?"
Hermes," Dwight, you remember the crew."
Bender," That dirty, double-crossing bastard! How dare he run off with Richard Nixon!"
Leela," Dr. Zoidberg, cut open that bag!"
Bender, And yet he looks so natural.
Leela," We're on it, Mr. Farnsworth."
Farnsworth," Bender, stop shutting the hell up!"
Hermes, Item one  Box. Check! Item two  Sun. That's a big check.
Zoidberg, Please don't hit me. I'm brittle!
Fry," It's OK, Leela, go ahead. I got a lot of work to do."
Zoidberg, Goose liver? Fish eggs? Pah! Where's the goose? Where's the fish?
Leela, It's got every piece of information anyone could ever want.
Farnsworth," That's right, Ricardo. A ship in a bottle! What's that? Well hang on, I'll look."
Hermes," As you can see, since Bender's death, requests to bite one's shiny metal ass are down 98%. Do you mind doing that later?!"
Leela," No, it's a scam!"
Fry, Hello? Anyone? There's never a cop around when you need one.
Leela," Oh, Fry. All this time you've had this incredible gift and I never knew. I've been a fool. A fully-justified, prudent fool. They're so cold."
Leela, So what does this mean for us and our many fans?
Leela," Alright, Beelzebot, what'll it take to get our friend back?"
Leela, Well at least it sounds like you were able to keep your consciousness separate from hers.
Hermes, We don't have that kind of money. Especially not Zoidberg.
Zoidberg, Hooray!
Bender," Wonderful. Then you'll all come to my exceedingly long, un-air-conditioned baptism ceremony!"
Fry, There! Finished!
Fry, Wow the 3-D's great!
Fry," I can't believe this! Bender is supposed to murder his closest friend, which I thought was me. But he went straight for you. He didn't even try to second-degree murder me."
Fry, Uh-oh. This space neighborhood looks kind of sketchy.
Hermes, It's a video will. It shows you killing him.
Bender," Oh, it's a turnstile."
Amy," Kiffy, you're alive!"
Bender, Can do!
Zoidberg," Oh, no! No! No! Oh, no, no, no! Oh, no!"
Leela, Go nuts.
Bender, Whoever's directing this is a master of suspense!
Leela, Did he use his tongue?
Amy, Hmmm. I guess I'm still kinda nervous.
Fry, Shucks. It's still only half as beautiful as you. Whoa!
Bender," Wait! I'm not Nikolai! I'm Bender, the fabulous body-switching burglar."
Leela, That's ridiculous. The Bermuda Tetrahedron is just a myth.
Fry," ""Must let occur."""
Farnsworth," No, I'm just very old."
Leela, Look out!
Bender, Zoidberg?
Fry," Leela, you beaned a run-in. You'd better let me pitch."
Zoidberg, I've had it with this game! I'm going for a scuttle!
Bender, Is he dumb or just ugly?
Bender, That'll teach those scammers and me.
Fry," My fellow mutants, until recently, I dwelt on the surface where a man can gaze up at the sky in wonder without a wet clump falling in his mouth."
Bender, So we're cool?
Fry," OK, you're on a date. What's the first thing you do?"
Fry, That was fun. Let's give him a treat!
Leela, Look at yourself. You're a wreck! You've got to find a new place to live.
Fry," Look! Slurm! Finally! Oh, yeah! I'm never going 12 minutes without a Slurm again."
Leela, Let's take the rest of the morning off and take Fry to do everything he ever wanted to do.
Bender," Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this big!"
Bender, Oh! Oh! Who's there?!
Farnsworth," Bender, what the Hell are you doing?"
Fry, That I will.
Fry," Alright, team, let's go find that clover!"
Bender, Damn it! It won't go on.
Hermes, The shares were worthless and he kept asking for toilet paper.
Farnsworth," But how can we? Oh, I wish, I wish, I wish we weren't in prison!"
Leela, I'm thinking of having a window installed.
Fry, There goes my new kitchen cabinets.
Fry, Woah!
Fry, I never stop to think about it.
Farnsworth," Oh, look, Bender. If you want something to do stop making out and give us a hand."
Bender, Guy! Guys! You've gotta see this. You're not gonna believe it!
Leela, They're so lifeless-like.
Fry, Wow! I can't believe it. One more promotion and I'll be a real detective. Like Sherlock Holmes or Speed Buggy.
Amy," Kif! You have so much creativity and niceness, but I'm not ... ... sure if I--"
Hermes," Leela, muzzle that skunk! We can't stop a meeting for some cute, fuzzy, little... Hey, look, a kitty cat."
Fry, Thanks!
Hermes," Oh, it's true. But they grow up so fast. We just wanted a few more years of being better than them."
Fry, I should be the one in that grave!
Zoidberg, This is where you live? I though you were a big-shot Hollywood movie star.
Hermes," Bender, eh? That guy's really startin' to twist my dreads."
Bender, Never!
Bender, A test! I demand a test!
Farnsworth, They robbed me of my dignity And most of my stuff.
Leela," Fry, I wish you'd throw out these week-old Popplers. They're getting big and scaly. Ooh, there's one left."
Farnsworth, Let's get down to business.
Fry, It was bound to be somewhere.
Bender, I could if you'd drop the stupid gold violin!
Bender," Look, no offence, but I need technology. Especially email and snowmobiles. And television! Without television how will I know what's buzz-worthy?"
Farnsworth," This, um, scientific breakthrough ... heralds a new dawn in human-robot relations, yes."
Hermes," Well, now I've heard everything on my eyePod.  So, do you have a new plan, Professor, and is there any hope left?"
Bender," Hey, Fry, I'm steering with my ass!"
Hermes, Sweet honey bee of infinity!
Bender, I better carve a shiv for protection.
Fry, I can't believe you're really real. I like your tail.
Fry," I understood the word ""hat""!"
Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for ... ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud!"
Fry," Nope, I'm better than ever. Before the accident I couldn't do this!"
Fry," Come on, Bender! You can do it."
Fry," I don't know what to do, Leela. Should I move in with Colleen and her four other boyfriends?"
Fry, And initial here.
Bender, Ew!
Leela, Don't give up yet. I've got one more trick up my sleeve.
Amy, It's hopeless. Even in theory the device can only apply force in one direction.
Farnsworth, Hey! Turn that damn music-- Up!
Leela," No! It's the principle of the thing. Besides, I think I see a parking lot up ahead."
Farnsworth, Let's find out.
Fry, Is it me?
Fry," Hey, Francis."
Leela," You know, Yivo, I've loved and lost so many times that I was afraid. But I'm not anymore. I want to stay here, with you."
Zoidberg," Well, editing is a long and expensive process but we spent all the money on pies, so it'll be ready Friday."
Leela, No! A grounded teenager must be confined to her room!
Bender," And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third time. But that would be it. When we kiss, I feel like I'm standing waist-deep in a pool of cold, rising water."
Bender, Haven't I done enough already?
Bender," Of course I realize it. Does that mean I can't enjoy it? Boy, were we suckers."
Bender," Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler."
Bender, Those bastards won't know what leafed through them. It's on!
Leela, They smell like burning Rhesus Monkey.
Farnsworth, Doomsday device? Ah! Now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! I suppose I could part with one and still be feared.
Farnsworth," Wait, surely there's a better--"
Fry, Did we all just have some kind of freaky dream or was it ghosts?
Leela, You're Fry's relative. Do you have any idea how he got so crazy?
Amy," Ah, it's a wonderful night."
Leela," Bender, I understand your desire to be remembered. But you don't need a statue for that."
Leela," Come on Fry, walk like a robot."
Farnsworth, Not at all. It's very simple.
Bender, Phew!
Bender, So that's where I left my cigar.
Leela, Nudar! How did you survive the doom blast?
Fry," Hey, Brain-y! Think fast!"
Fry, Why were we so angry and jealous back in our universe?
Leela, We're close to the exit. I can smell those filthy orange guys.
Fry," Anyway, I'm sure it'll work out. This way we'll both be happy."
Bender," Hey, look, Leela, it's that idiotic windbag you slept with."
Fry, Where did Cubert come from?
Fry, This is perfect for me.
Farnsworth," That's true. By current academic standards, you're merely a high school dropout."
Leela, And I forgot this isn't a hovercar.
Farnsworth," There was Candy, the raunchy by-the-books navigator... Lifter, the devastatingly handsome forklift... And Captain Lando Tucker, a dedicated young man with no characteristics."
Farnsworth," Dear Lord, Bender, you're filthy."
Fry, We missed the turn. We'll never catch them.
Farnsworth, And here it is  Slightly over 99 years later and still no revenge. I'm essentially in the clear.
Leela, How can this be? I thought the Benders drank all the alcohol in the world!
Fry, Being captain is obviously more important to you than being my friend. I'm going.
Farnsworth, Microscopic Nanobots. They're tiny robots I designed to eat up nasty irritants.
Hermes, Just walk around not wearing a helmet.
Leela," Hermes, who were you yelling at?"
Bender, Doooo...
Leela, That guy sounds familiar.
Leela," Oh, no! It's midnight."
Bender, I don't know. Do you think you could survive a 700ft fall?
Hermes," I understand. Womanhood also takes some getting used to. For example, did you know there are more than two feelin's?"
Farnsworth, Yo!
Bender," Yeah, life is hilariously cruel. Permission to come aboard, Wiggles?"
Leela, Let's mutiny!
Zoidberg, Ah!
Bender," Give him hell, Morbo!"
Fry," I'm capable of making my own decisions, Leela. Did you ever stop to think I might be happier with gills?"
Zoidberg," Welcome, one and all. I finally figured out how money could make me happy. By using it to buy my hungry friends a feast."
Leela, You're charging us? After you blinded me?
Amy, The Great Pyramid at Giza!
Farnsworth," Hold on! I got it. We can't go back in time, but we can keep going forward until people invent the backwards time machine."
Leela, Whoa!
Bender, Too bad it's a dump.
Zoidberg, Hmm. Serious drama. Perhaps it is time to give up comedy.
Farnsworth, Certain clues suggest that the culprit is none other than our own ... Philip J. Fry!
Farnsworth," Say, what's this?"
Bender," He must have left the city. Man, this could take all day."
Zoidberg," So, now Zoidberg is big, huh? That's more like it! Who's intimidating who now, big city? Hello, Mr. Chase Manhattan Bank. Deny my credit card application, will you? Ah, the famed Apollo Theater. ""Boo"" me off stage on open-mic night, huh? I'll show you!"
Farnsworth," You left the keys in the ignition. I mean, look at those two. Wasn't it obvious what would happen?"
Fry, The thief seems to be some sorta ghost. Or is he? Bender?!
Farnsworth, Exactly!
Bender," Sorry I'm tardy, old bean. I was just enjoying a rather tasty watercress sandwich."
Fry, Me too.
Farnsworth, Shut up!
Leela, Lars?
Bender, I don't wanna be rescued.
Bender," Well, that was rude."
Zoidberg, Me?
Leela, It's just ... my life is changing so fast. I don't know who I am anymore.
Leela, This doesn't make any sense.
Amy, Yay!
Leela," No, it isn't. Guys! Come on out!"
Bender," Alright, environment, you've met your match!"
Zoidberg," Hermes, I'm a surgeon. When I see two body parts I sew them together and see what happens."
Hermes," Now we all love Nibbler, so it's only fair that we all pitch in and clean it up together. Still, I propose we make Zoidberg do it. All in favour?"
Farnsworth, Indeed.
Fry, Yup.
Bender," Hell, no! It's Leela's stupid feelings. Why can't she just drink herself happy like a normal person?"
Fry, This is a mutiny.
Fry, Sorry.
Farnsworth," Ta-da! This is my ancestor Philo Farnsworth, inventor of television and, as a bonus, childhood obesity. And here's Dean Farnsworth, developer of the Farnsworth test for colour blindness. Where is he, blast it?! And, just recently, I learned of a modern-day Farnsworth, who invented the anti-senility truss."
Fry," Why, Mr. Peppy? Why? Ooh. That tickles. Now I really do have to kill you."
Fry, Woo-hoo! Throw down dinosaurs of the land and sea. This is a cool way to die!
Leela, Whiskey OK?
Bender," What seems to be the problem, officers? Was I speeding?"
Hermes," As you all know, Leela's living will states that in the event of coma, her body is to be fed to the wild Cyclophage, a highly endangered creature that eats only cyclopses."
Bender, What?
Amy," Hi, Bender."
Amy," Fool me seven times, shame on you. Fool me eight or more times, shame on me."
Leela," Whatever you said, forget it!"
Farnsworth," Uh-oh, this may take a while."
Leela, What is it?
Fry," Hey, watch out!"
Leela, Why do we have to resort to non-violence? Can't we just kick their asses?
Bender," Gracias. Now, I could find Leela, but you'll need to authorize a wiretap."
Zoidberg, What's that enscribbled on it?
Bender," That's some fine oil-ade, son. We could use a man like you in the Robot Mafia, which I'm sorta in."
Fry," Where's all th' Presidents' heads, then?"
Leela," How we doing, Amy?"
Farnsworth," Don't be daft, Bender. Yivo can't breathe outside the electric ether of shkler own universe. If shklee came here, shklee would shkluffocate."
Fry, Wait. I can read minds and my mind can't be read. I have a plan.
Leela," Look at that five o'clock rust. You've been up all night not drinking, haven't you?"
Farnsworth," Go ahead, get into these net suits. I designed and tested them myself."
Farnsworth," and  One, two, three, pull!"
Bender," Huh, w-what? I didn't hear you. I was too busy using this F-ray to look inside of things."
Bender, I'm 40% zinc.
Farnsworth, Where could Farnsworth have minted such a high quality fake?
Farnsworth," Status reports, Science Officer."
Farnsworth," Clam up, founding fathers! We need help locating the treacherous forger who forged this forgery!"
Zoidberg, I hope we all have as much tomorrow at my birth--
Leela, That's great.
Farnsworth," Yes, it's been quite an hour and a half."
Bender," Kill-check three is go! Also, the salad's ready."
Bender," You wouldn't know perversion if it put clamps on your testicles! You're just jealous, 'cause you've never known true love."
Fry, We've been looking for you. Last we heard you were under arrest as a human sympathiser.
Fry," Good! Don't finish that cruller, throw it away Bender. Drink that beer and drop the bottle on the ground. Very nice."
Leela, and  In marriage.
Farnsworth," Of course, a wormhole! We'll simply disappear and reappear in a... ...nother part of the universe."
Bender, Shove it! We quit!
Hermes, You know you did it!
Bender, Just like at the movie theatre!
Farnsworth," Cram it, Virginia! Pine trees have been extinct for over eight hundred years."
Leela," There. Good as new! Except we're three miles below the surface, we don't have any food and the ship won't work underwater."
Leela," Good luck, Bender!"
Zoidberg, Damn right!
Fry," I tell you, that Butch runs a pretty good civilisation. I think I'll enjoy serving under him."
Bender, No!
Farnsworth," Movietone News, everyone. I've discovered a new comet!"
Bender," ""Avoid committing the crime"". Got it."
Farnsworth," Oh, sure! Smash the smart guy's machine!"
Bender, No! It's just ... neither of us can get up when we get knocked on our back.
Farnsworth," We gotta be real, real careful to stay in just long enough to make us our right ages again. Zoidberg! Get out of there!"
Fry, Neat!
Leela, I can't make out a thing!
Bender, Dum dum away. Zero zero one one ....
Bender," Bless you, sir."
Leela, Shh! I'm a fugitive.
Farnsworth," Oh, criminy!"
Bender," You're my kind of soldier, Lemon. A foul-mouthed, barrel-chested, beer-bellied pile of ugly muscle."
Leela, Bender! You're three hours late. You can't give up on your training now after both of us worked so hard.
Farnsworth," So that's the situation. Due to the short-sightedness of Old New York, New New York is going to be destroyed by a giant ball of garbage."
Fry," Yeah, well, I'll show you. And Mr. Bananas. Anyway, I've got nothin' better to do while I'm sick in bed. Wait. That's it! I'll make a space experiment about the common cold! Where's that contest flyer?"
Farnsworth," And, now that I've found all the answers, I realise that what I was living for were the questions!"
Fry, Who cares? We're 35 points ahead with two minutes left. What could possibly--
Bender, Now how about a rose for the lady? Five bucks a pop!
Leela, I love rocket skating! But the wait is always so long. Poor Fry once stood in line for six hours just to get me a ticket.
Fry, Who was that guy?
Zoidberg," I hear turkey. Woop-woop-woop-woop-woop— Oh, boy. Ay... Ay. Ay."
Hermes," Oh, take it easy, Leela."
Fry, Leela!
Bender, TV party tonight!
Bender, Who is he? I'll kill him!
Leela, Sleeping with you.
Fry," You don't have to beat around the bush, Leela. We all know who you're talking about ... uh, me, right?"
Farnsworth," You're falling into the final debilitating stages of womanhood. You've waited too long to switch back, you ding bat!"
Amy," Mom, Dad, I'd like you to meet Fry, my boyfriend."
Farnsworth, Blackmail? What does she have on you?
Leela, Three.
Leela, Really?
Leela, Hang on. Amy Wong? Of the Mars Wongs?
Bender," What do you mean, ""we""?"
Leela," OK, it's just an ordinary coffin. Containing my ordinary dead friend, who I killed."
Farnsworth," No, I haven't needed a butler since grad school. But I do need a doctor. I don't wanna die like those marines, John. The fever! The madness!"
Farnsworth, Jungles? On Earth?
Leela, Does anybody mind if I take command?
Fry, Of course I've been up all night! Not because of caffeine. It was insomnia. I couldn't stop thinking about coffee. I need a nap. Coffee time!
Zoidberg," Don't mind if I already did. By the way, do you have anymore of this Dom Perignon bubble bath? There was only enough to fill the tub halfway."
Farnsworth, Mmm! Damn good meat!
Fry," Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. When's the funeral?"
Fry, What's with the seventeen dung beetles?
Farnsworth," And I hit Farnsworth much, much harder. Eh, perhaps too hard."
Farnsworth," My clone, Cubert Farnsworth."
Leela, But it's so beautiful.
Amy, They have a college kid wear that to attract customers.
Hermes, Get him!
Bender, Don't mind me. I'm just saving you the trouble of throwing me away.
Fry, A what?
Bender," Oh, your God!"
Leela, Just give me your hand.
Fry," I swear.  I didn't know this would happen.  The only thing I truly know is I love you. I mean her—Wait, help me out here."
Fry, Uh-oh.
Farnsworth, Download her. Let's just put a blank robot in the drive.
Bender, Hey! Keep it down in there! I'm tuning my banjo!
Bender," Hey, everybody. Meet my good pal, Roberto."
Leela, Let's go to my place.
Leela, Uch!  That's the worst thing I've ever seen!
Zoidberg, Then the illusion is complete.
Leela," Satisfied, Zoidberg? My relationship with my parents is fine."
Leela, I say yes.
Amy, I resent that!
Fry, This is horrible.
Farnsworth," Hello, Francis."
Amy, Boring. Let's hear about Walter Mondale already!
Hermes, Who you gonna call?
Hermes, Thank you. It was cold down there on the floor.
Bender," Don't melt me down into a crowbar,"
Bender," And then he was ejected by the guards. Needless to say, I was mortified."
Amy, Really? I don't think so.
Hermes," Oh, Bender's a model employee."
Bender, What what?
Fry, So let me get this straight  This planet is completely uninhabited?
Bender, Aww. You know what always cheers me up? Laughing at other people's misfortunes.
Fry," Look, I know Flexo's your friend but I don't trust him alone with the atom."
Fry," Uh, aren't we looking for your gargoyle?"
Hermes," Alright, alright. What do we do when we break somebody's window?"
Amy, Wow!
Leela, If a guy ever did that to me I'd know it. Wait a second. They've all been doing that to me. Even Sean!
Fry, Does that mean it's safe to breathe the air?
Leela," No, and with wind-chill it's 20 degrees below absolute zero. I'd better go find him."
Farnsworth," Good news, nuchachos! The ship is nearly repaired."
Leela," Wake up, everyone! I've got something. And this time it's alive! Dr. Zoidberg, since when do you even wear boots?"
Leela, A new eyePhone? Forget this junk.
Hermes," The important thing is that we don't panic. There are rules for situations like this. Now, the first order of business is lunch. I suggest a nice lobster Zoidberg-- I mean lobster Newburg-- I mean Doctor Zoidberg."
Bender," You morons! I don't know what you're trying to pull but I got half a mind to hug each and every one of you and see how you like it! Oh, come on!"
Fry," Uh, what about garbage?"
Farnsworth," Eh, okay. Uh, come on, gang. Let's go inoculate everyone and cram Manhattan back into its rightful hole!"
Farnsworth," No, I've been busy."
Bender, I can't see what's happening. Are we boned?
Leela, We're here to see the Professor.
Leela," They're not filthy! They're wholesome, fertile, and fresh from the forest floor. There's some filth."
Bender," Yes, I am. Having just this minute regained consciousness."
Leela," No, I just work here."
Amy, Wait. What about the girly calendar?
Farnsworth," Nothing will go wrong. If something goes wrong, bring back the blood."
Bender, I hope they can make change for a fortune.
Bender," Your loss. Hey, Professor, you're my wingman."
Leela," Give it to us straight, Professor. How incredibly deadly is it?"
Fry," Bender, if this is some kind of scam, I don't get it. You already have my power of attorney."
Farnsworth," Far from it. If you ask me, they look like a bunch of hookers. But what I have invented is a means of locating the missing crystal. When I push this button, the crystal will emit a high-frequency stink."
Leela," Wait! Why do the raised letters that normally say ""Turn Master Steering Wheel Company"" say ""Nibbler""? Oh, no!"
Bender, It feels like I'm trying to push a water bed outta me.
Leela," You sure you're okay, Fry? You do have tin foil on your head."
Amy," Hooray, we're back in business!"
Bender," Listen, pipsqueak, are you Philip J. Fry or not? 'Cause if you are, I'm here to kill you."
Bender," Oh, I'm leaving!"
Fry, Ka-boom?
Leela, You went to college?
Leela, Follow me!
Fry, I hate you! I hate you! You evil metal man! Ow!
Leela," We can't, you bastard! No one knows how it works. It's impossible!"
Fry, You're not even trying!
Bender," Hey, what the hell are you doing? Quit hugging me!"
Bender," It's a little thing called ""style"". Look it up sometime."
Farnsworth," Oh, this is all my fault!"
Zoidberg," A fortune, it is! At last Zoidberg will live like a rich man!"
Fry," Speaking of nasty irritants, what's going to become of Cubert?"
Fry, Um ... uh...
Fry," Well, whatever it is, it's even better fresh. Mmm, still warm."
Fry," Oh, dip!"
Leela," OK, everyone, calm down. The Professor and I will get to work on the ship. Bender, Zoidberg, since you can survive underwater, you'll go out and look for food."
Leela, I ... have to tell ... must ... important ... something--
Bender, Who the hell is he?
Leela, Aww!
Hermes," There, there, Fry. He may be gone, but he'll always be with us as a trash can."
Farnsworth," Yes. If by ""allow"" you mean ""force""."
Hermes," Oh, my swollen feet. He takes his feet out of the tub of water. They have turned into clown shoes] I better take my pills."
Leela, Only when he's in them and you know it. You really hurt his feelings.
Bender," It's okay, Hermes. We're all here for you."
Bender, Yo! I read the script and I think it would help my character's motivation if he was on fire.
Leela, Hi. I'm Leela.
Amy," Then Kif flew Betsy, rescued me from the tornado and made peace with the Martians."
Bender, Got it. Preparing to terminate Philip Fry!
Bender," Wow, you guys run numbers?"
Bender," You know, it's funny."
Bender," Yeah, yeah, I can take a hint."
Leela, Do you know what it means?
Leela," Strike one, a personal best!"
Leela, It's hopeless! I can't coordinate this many ships!
Farnsworth," Bender, as my newest employee, could you bend this drinking straw for me?"
Bender, That's right! I'm sober and crazy and I don't know what I might do!
Bender," Oh, yeah! You filthy hobos sure know how to live. Hey, chief, someone's stealing your handkerchief full of crap."
Bender, Hurry! We're missing our bus!
Leela, Let's blow this tomb!
Zoidberg, Hello.
Bender, Ah!
Farnsworth," It would seem we've taught our boys a lesson about life  Man or Blob, it's what's inside that counts."
Fry," Hey, I got you guys refrigerator magnets."
Amy, So how was the Spleef Nebula?
Leela," I hate being a man. I smell bad, my face is scratchy, and the food at those strip clubs is terrible."
Bender," That's me, baby! Let me just ditch the kids in an alley and we can go have some fun."
Fry," Hey, pretty nice for a single. Two desks, two chairs, a couple of beds. A woodpecker."
Fry," No, you don't. I've got no home, no family--"
Hermes," Old pal? 8.5 seconds ago, you said you hated me."
Hermes, My Speedos!
Hermes, This is what makes life worth clinging to; three fathers enjoying a day out with their sons.
Bender," This has been a test of the Emergency Hypnotoad System.  Had this been an actual hypnosis, you would go limp and watch whatever crap comes on next.  Comin' up next  Futurama!"
Fry, Wait.  I thought we were buying our eyePhones online.
Fry, Grandpa's making up crazy stories again.
Leela, I'd better light some candles.
Fry," Leela, I'm no doctor, but I'm afraid you be exhibiting symptoms of illin'. You're risking all our lives for your own personal obsession."
Fry," Then she wants me as a trophy husband. Leela, you gotta come to Europa with us. I can't be alone with her."
Fry," Sure would. Oh, well. Goodbye."
Zoidberg," No, the double-vomit is a sign of joy. Fry told me how he and Colleen first met."
Fry, Yup.
Farnsworth," Well, I guess that wraps everything up in a nice, paradox-free bow."
Fry, DOOP? What's that?
Leela, Oops.
Bender," Hey, buddy!"
Fry," Hey, what's this goop?"
Farnsworth," Yes! In your face, Wernstrom!"
Amy, Cheers!
Farnsworth," That's my prize-winning Smellescope. If a dog craps anywhere in the universe, you can bet I won't be out of the loop. And this is my universal translator. Unfortunately so far it only translates into an incomprehensible dead language."
Fry," Cocoa is for yodelling babies. If you're sober, it isn't ice fishing."
Bender," I love cooking and Elzar's ass loves getting kissed, right?"
Zoidberg, Fine! Just give me something crawling with parasites.
Farnsworth," Very serious, Mayor Poopenmeyer."
Leela," Let's try him out. Robot 1-X, can you clean Nibbler's stanky litterbox?"
Fry," I'm about to. Leela, let me play for you one for time."
Fry, Then where are we? You said you knew how to navigate.
Hermes," They shrink-wrapped the hole city! Well, it could be worse. It is worse!"
Bender," Hey, you can't (voice slowing)turn me off..."
Fry," This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's plans with some goon and I'm gonna be stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will you be my date, please?"
Amy," No. So, Fry, you busy tomorrow? I got two tickets to the big ape fight."
Leela," Captain, we were supposed to land two days ago. Is everything— Hey!"
Fry," Yeah, well here's a funny joke  I'm gonna sit right here till it's my shift."
Fry," Me, too."
Leela, Fry--
Bender, So I returned his artificial heart and ever since then I've been known by the name of Honest Bender.
Zoidberg, Please! I am certain I will succeed with my delicate manner. Oops.
Leela, Quiet. I think I know how to find the Professor.
Amy, Are you sure there's no other way to get the buggalo out?
Bender," From now on, you guys'll do all the work while I sit on the couch and do nothing."
Farnsworth, Exactly! And now Saturn.
Bender, He could be a storage closet...
Fry, I don't get it. How can you say Lars is more mature than me?
Farnsworth, Where am I now?
Zoidberg, Yes. Now.
Leela, So that Moon hillbilly who got murdered was just an innocent husband and father!
Fry," I hope you win, Leela."
Amy," Shmeepers, it's the Land Titanic, the biggest and onlyest land boat ever constructed..."
Fry," Hey, Bender, how's dinner coming?"
Bender," Some breaking occurred, the dolly was involved, that's about all we know."
Leela," I'm a woman, if that's what you mean. I don't like to play games, so I'll just say I'm a cyclops, I'm a spaceship captain, I'm the only one of my species and I'm interested in meeting a man."
Leela," Oh, I'm scared! My whole life has just been a show for some perverted mutant!"
Farnsworth, You're Robo-Hungarian?
Leela," My old life wasn't as glamorous as my webpage made it look. All I ever wanted was to grow up here, with you. Please?"
Amy, Bender was a truly special--
Bender," If you had kids of your own, you'd understand!"
Amy, It seems their movements are a form of language. Rather than speaking Ja—
Amy, A giant sausage!
Farnsworth, He may have ocean madness but that's no excuse for ocean rudeness.
Fry," Hey, hang on, All My Circuits is about to start!"
Fry, Love the tentacle!
Farnsworth," Alright, alright, so the machine produces a few toxic by-products! You don't have to make a federal case out of it."
Bender," You shut up. No, wait! I can use you as a tool to save my friends and I'll still be the hero who everyone says how great he was!"
Farnsworth, Speak for yourself!
Leela, We all have to share in the guilt. Which is why we're each going to add one drop of cyanide to the death wheel as it goes by.
Fry, Whoa!
Fry," At the risk of sounding stupid, do these things actually work?"
Bender, Wow!
Hermes, Nope.  It's not in the Janeway's Guide either.
Fry," Not the gem. This passenger manifest. It turns out there were mutants on that ship, working below deck in the sewage galley."
Farnsworth, Rarely went outside!
Fry," Hey, uh, what's with all the pots and pans? You building a wife?"
Leela," You've made a terrible mistake. He's a human being, not a machine. Oh, Fry!"
Leela, Of course I'm awake. You wouldn't stop waking me. Where am I?
Bender," Yo, Captain Cataract? What are we doing here?"
Leela, What in hell happened to Bender?
Hermes, And I said I'd try my very best.
Bender," You know, I'm also an Ultimate Robot Lover."
Leela," Well, gentlemen, it appears we're boned."
Leela, It's so tragic.
Hermes, We'll go across the street to Pottery Barn and steal their fire!
Fry, You can. All you have to do is wake up.
Bender, Hermes! Hermes! Remember that flock of bats?
Farnsworth," Yes, yes. Anyhow, I've designed an oil-eating bacterium that should take the tar right off."
Leela," Miss Wong, you have the 'poon."
Fry," I like ice cream. And I like lollipops. And I like you, Princess Num Num."
Bender," ""$500"", you say?"
Fry, Go ahead. Just chuck it any old place like I used to. Your city is counting on you.
Hermes," It's been a good run, people, but this is the end."
Fry," Mine too, even my change."
Leela, Sure!
Bender," If they put me on a stamp, tell them to use the young Bender."
Amy, Hooray! Look at all these presents!
Bender, And what better way to celebrate our success than by me showing Bubblegum the Globetrotter uniform I made myself!
Bender, Who will make Bender waffles just the way he likes them now?
Fry," Seems to be. My neck's just a little tender. Ow! Cool! Ow! Listen, Leela. Thanks for rescuing me last night."
Leela, There's nothing wrong with our clunker.
Hermes," Planet Express ship, you are cleared to land."
Leela, And yet you guys never had a single nuclear war.
Bender, Aw!
Leela, That's Lrrr! Ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8.
Leela," Hey, you know what might be a hoot?"
Zoidberg, That just leaves Best Soft-Drink Product Placement and then Best Actor. We don't have much time.
Amy," This is M5438, an entity of pure energy."
Leela, Fry went to the party?
Leela, No effect. The crystals are bouncing off the tentacle like meatballs off Mothra.
Farnsworth," Oh, my."
Leela, Blech.
Fry, But this is HDTV. It's got better resolution than the real world!
Fry," Yeah, if it's real, how come there's no song that explains how you celebrate it?"
Amy, Uh-huh! Amy Wong. And you are?
Leela, Bummer.
Zoidberg," Oh, yeah, why not?"
Leela, Nice nebula.
Leela, I almost had that tiara.
Amy," Oh, excuse me. Hello, there!"
Fry," Oh, no! This is terrible."
Bender, Hey! What the ...?
Leela, All aboard for Neptune!
Bender," Hey, look! I found a robot fossil!"
Leela," Ew! I'm Turanga Leela, captain of the current Planet Express ship. What's going on?"
Zoidberg, Maybe we can plotz in that giant cockle.
Leela," Well, you could bother me a little."
Farnsworth, We were defeated in battle.
Farnsworth," So many loves half-loved, so many inventions half-invented. That damn time machine alone set me back 15 years."
Zoidberg, Gross.
Zoidberg," You're right, my stink gland is weak. Smell!"
Zoidberg, What? I thought I was playing for my freedom!
Zoidberg," Sorry I didn't call first, Carol. Uh... But I'm in a hurry! I need your help to save Hubert!"
Bender," Oh, I'm going! You're gonna be all ""Where's Bender? I miss Bender""."
Leela, Oh. Do I know you?
Bender, Yeah! And this beer can is made outta old robots.
Amy, Ew!
Fry," Yup, she's beautiful coffee alright."
Farnsworth," This isn't a business. I've always thought of it more as a source of cheap labour, like a family."
Fry," Who does he think he is, being polite to you? You want me to beat him up?"
Bender," What are you doing, wonderful masters?"
Leela, He'll do it. He's crazy!
Bender, Well make time.
Fry, Oh!
Leela, This all must have something to do with the secret ingredient.
Bender, It's gonna blow!
Bender, No fair!
Fry, That's funny!
Fry," Hey, I can get a date too. Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!"
Farnsworth," I was lying here, snoozing, dreaming, oddly enough, about bathing in champagne with six of the world's most distinguished scientists, when suddenly I realised my bathwater had been transformed into alcohol."
Bender," You know what? You're right. He was just a stupid bureaucrat. A stupid paper-pushing bureaucrat. A stupid I-dotting, chair squashing, Oh. No offense, Hermes. You're not like that. I mean, you're exactly like that, but you're okay! In fact, I'm putting you on the do-no-kill list. Come on, fellow mortal. We're in Tijuana. I wanna live a little. Help, I'm gonna die! That's the opposite of what I want!"
Leela, It doesn't have to.
Leela," Susan and I are agreed.  For the first time in our lives, we're not ashamed of who we are."
Leela," Pert and Popular, sir."
Bender, To volunteer at a liquor kitchen for homeless robots.
Bender," Better! We got fembots with illegal five-speed groins! Shalom, Ruth and Esther!"
Leela," Guys, I didn't have time to mention it up there, but I want each of you to know what an honour it is to work with me."
Fry, I'm your dear old Uncle Fry.
Fry, Really? Which one?
Bender," I'm telling you, my broken friend..."
Bender," Whatchoo talkin' 'bout, Fry?"
Fry," Bender, I don't claim to understand ""the biz"" but wouldn't being able to move help your music career?"
Amy," Aren't you gonna say Good news, everyone?"
Bender," Oh, so we can stay in the future you like? But not the future I like? Next!"
Bender, Martini drinking contests with the autopilot. I would've had him this time but we ran out of olives.
Zoidberg," What is it, Fry?"
Leela, Some lazy or polite robot is holding it in.
Bender, Uh. Nothing.
Farnsworth, Wha?
Fry, And I can't take life anymore.
Amy, We're doomed!
Bender, Dork calling Orson! Dork calling Orson!
Bender," Well, we're boned."
Fry," Uh, not right now."
Leela," Fry, was this an idiotic trick to get Lars and me back together?"
Leela," Well, for one thing, his chequebook doesn't have the Hulk on it."
Fry, So? Let it go. Don't let your temper get the better of...
Amy, That's true. On a TV like this I bet you couldn't even make out my obscene tattoo.
Fry," Don't be afraid of the tentacle, Leela. It's beautiful and it loves me. And I love it."
Bender," Well, that doesn't sound so bad."
Fry, This is where I brought my girlfriend on our very first date.
Leela, Not unless your parents have thousands of helicopters at their disposal.
Farnsworth," My, yes. Ooh, just like that. Any luck, Bubblegum?"
Bender, What about my servants?
Bender," Well, looks like the party's winding down. Let's take a road trip to Tijuana and get Fat-bot some action."
Amy," Wow, neat."
Bender, Shut up already! Calculon's on TV!
Fry, Butt massager engaged?
Bender, They look like dorks!
Fry," Bender, wait. While you can still calculate the future, just tell me  What's gonna happen with me an' Leela?"
Zoidberg, Then you'll need someone to dissect it! Friend.
Fry, Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked unless it was really high or really low.
Fry, Bender? How did the fight go? I heard somebody got flattened!
Leela, Okay. That's better. Keep 'em comin'!
Hermes," Come on, mon!"
Fry," In my whole life, this company was the only place I'd ever really felt at home. If being millionaires is more important to you than our--"
Bender, Me too. Me too. Jerk.
Fry, Hermes.
Fry, I'm over here!
Bender, It's my brains against your von Braun!
Leela, That was nice.
Farnsworth," It's a sign of respect, you savage!"
Zoidberg, Congratulations. I assume Amy is the father.
Amy," Hey, how about some icy margaritas?"
Fry," Yeah, I asked a cop once. It means ""Up yours, kid""."
Amy, Look! A clearance sale!
Leela, Are you alright? Has he hurt you?
Leela, Death by sonic diarrhoea?
Bender, I can't believe somebody hired an interstellar spaceship to deliver a package to Atlantic City. What are we delivering anyway?
Leela," Depth at 45 hundred feet, 48 hundred, 50 hundred! 5000 feet!"
Fry," So, what's the secret ingredient?"
Fry," Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join the country club."
Fry, But I don't like being a delivery boy.
Fry, I wanna see the edge of the universe!
Bender, Just a sec.
Farnsworth," Oh, my, no. That would require extremely tiny atoms, and have you priced those lately? I'm not made of money! Leave me alone!"
Fry," Uh, Ms. Johnson? Please bring in some more chair fuel."
Leela," OK, if everyone's finished being stupid--"
Farnsworth," Everyone, I have a very dramatic announcement. So anyone with a weak heart should leave now. Goodbye."
Hermes, Look at all these famous lost ships. There's the Garmin. And the TomTom.
Fry, I recognise you. Didn't you use to have a body of some sort?
Fry, Even Celine Dion?
Bender," Well, perhaps I could call on TV's Calculon to help, now that I'm in showbiz."
Bender, I should be weeping! I'm not weeping!
Farnsworth, My god! It's the Pantheon!
Bender, You locate Inspector 5 while I slip into my ass-kicking feet.
Zoidberg, I had a hunch.
Bender," Oh, crap."
Fry, Leela?
Fry," Hey, Bender. Did you ever find that inspector guy you were looking for?"
Fry, I heard that one time you single-handedly defeated a horde of rampaging somethings in the something-something-system.
Fry," That's it! I'm getting a hundred cups of coffee. Starting now. Coffee machine, one cup of coffee, please."
Amy, It's a schmundered degrees and all we have to drink are non-diet sodas.
Bender," Kill me, please! And make it splatter!"
Farnsworth," It's a single atom of jumbonium, an element so rare the nucleus alone is worth more than $50,000."
Leela," OK, you're on the surface. Now I'll give you 10 minutes. Then you'll get bored, turn around and apologise for being such a jerk. Agreed?"
Fry, It's back on!
Amy, Do we have enough money to pay Bender's fine?
Fry," Hey, what you watching?"
Leela," Fry, we're worried about Planet Express."
Bender, ...I'll say it loud and sing it proud...
Zoidberg, Barbados Slim? I love that guy.
Farnsworth, Fuff! You're a disgrace to the very name Fowvwuh!
Hermes," Computer, analyze tapes and extract personality profile of one Turanga Leela."
Leela," If you can change form, why didn't you change it in the one place that counts?"
Fry, Hey.
Hermes," Sorry. It's in your contract. ""All female employees must pose nude if requested."""
Zoidberg, Is someone talking?
Bender, Anyone want butter on that?
Bender," Well, I guess you should've had two eyes!"
Bender," Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! And— And then Calculon said, ""No. No!"""
Leela," Well, I wouldn't mind rubbing my success in a few choice faces."
Bender, You're on! Send.
Zoidberg," You look wonderful, robut! I wish I could afford to go to a hospital. I'm dreadfully sick."
Leela," Aw, thanks. They're my inspiration."
Fry," C'mon, Bender! It's up to you to make your own decisions in life. That's what separates people and robots from animals ... and animal robots."
Farnsworth," Yes! It's sort of a Comedy Central channel, and we're on it now!"
Fry," Eh, I think I'll just stay here."
Fry, Not everything. There's still a roach problem.
Zoidberg," Then, if you'll excuse me, I see some ravioli that only has two shoe prints on it. Three."
Hermes," Sweet Yeti of the Serengeti, she's gone crazy eddie in the head-y."
Farnsworth, Actually that's still true.
Bender, What about you? You're my third choice.
Fry," Your Mayor-ness, if you execute him, you have to execute all of us."
Leela, Wow! Free bread at a restaurant? Is there anything you can't do?
Leela," Okay, so we haven't found any life yet. I still don't see why you men can't be happy with regular-sized miniature golf."
Fry, Alright. I'll take the red rocket.
Bender, Just tell me why.
Fry," No. No crazy technology. Here. Bender, use your immense Robot strength to drill a hole the old-fashioned way."
Farnsworth," Precisely.  However, the satellites collided shortly after launch and were never heard from again."
Bender, Alright!
Fry, And maybe you'd like to meet her. And her.
Hermes, Somebody turn it on!
Fry, I'm nobody. There are guys in the background of Mary Worth comics who are more important than me.
Bender," Friends? That activates my hilairity unit! I'm just a machine to you. You're no more friends with me than you are with the toaster, the phonograph or the electric chair."
Leela, We've got to go back in toime an' set things straight! 'Urry up an' lick Washin'ton's 'ead again!
Fry," Apology accepted. After all, you're only human."
Bender," Right on, sister. We should be back at Planet Express right now. Hiding from work in the ceiling. But no!"
Amy, Over my dead body!
Bender," Oh, Amy. I wonder where you are right now!"
Bender," Gee whiz, Santa! You want me to help you?"
Bender, Uh... Sure.
Bender, Right away!
Fry, Amy's a klutz from Mars.
Farnsworth," And you, Coach Smalley, or should I say ""Coach hairpiece""?"
Leela," Shake paws, Nibbler. Come on, shake. He might be a little hungry. Shake, boy. Usually he's had more ham by now. Shake!"
Fry, Bender?
Leela, Wow. Are you gross-looking. Go on.
Amy, Jinkies! He Scooby-Doo-ed us!
Zoidberg, It's toe-tapping-ly tragic.
Fry, This is awesome! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and teaching alien women to lurve?
Bender," Not even a little. There's nothing wrong with murder, just so long as you let Bender wet his beak."
Amy," Oh, I love stuff like the moon! Can I come, Leela?"
Farnsworth," Yes, and the only one of her species in all the known universe. What a lonely life."
Bender, And the Creator could also be a robot.
Farnsworth, Then there's nothing left to do! Nothing!
Leela," Bender, can you at least pretend you're being punished? And clean the black parts too."
Farnsworth, Aw. They don't make movies like this anymore.
Bender," Welcome, boss."
Fry," So that's where my clover is? Hey, is that orbiting cemetery near here?"
Leela, Ow!
Fry, What's wrong?
Hermes, We'll bill you for the couch.
Bender," Aw, mom! Do we hafta?!"
Leela, Ow! I might've liked Zapp Brannigan if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw me in prison.
Leela," Wake up, my king."
Fry," Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew where he was I'd go talk to him."
Leela, So what makes Guenter talk?
Fry, Hermes Conrad!
Bender," It's Elzar again! Oh, my God, I'm so excited, I wish I could wet my pants!"
Farnsworth," Oh, blithery poop, my cowardly lobster! You don't need courage. After all, who needs courage when you have a gun?"
Bender," Wow, Mars Vegas.  Long live the eternal city."
Hermes, Holy spitz! He's sportin' skintight Speedos!
Bender," Hey, Leela. Bubblegum might let me organise a bake sale for the Globetrotter wives. Can you teach me to make cupcakes?"
Farnsworth," Yes, we tore the universe a new space-hole alright! But it's clenching shut fast. Our only hope to get back to our own time is to go through it in, oh, say ... ... exactly 24 hours."
Leela," Oh, that's the corniest thing I've ever heard! Let me show you the bedroom."
Fry, What does it taste like?
Fry, Thanks. Where is she?
Zoidberg, I knew I should have gone with the ring-around-the-collar joke.
Leela," I said ""very nice work""."
Leela," Yo soy muy malo en lanzar, pero yo soy muy bueno en comer frijoles. Come los Bean Bay frijoles, los frijoles de los reyes."
Bender, Another job well done. Now back to the office for an enjoyable evening of fasting and repentance.
Leela, Dinner ready?
Leela, Don't worry.
Leela, What's Plan C?
Fry," Oh, no!"
Fry," Well, we can live without machines. I was in Webelos."
Fry, Get him!
Bender, It's what made me me.
Leela, I can't do this any more.
Fry, There's gotta be some way to stop Bender. Maybe something in the oracle's prediction that I missed before due to incompetence. Wait. Who's the trigger-happy jerk? That's me. I recognise the face.
Leela, I'll meet you at the south rim in one hour. No moustaches.
Hermes, To Fry.
Fry, You mean the window?
Farnsworth," Fry, I admire what you did today, and I'm deeply sorry for insulting your intellect. Your tiny, tiny intellect. Oops, there I go again, you dope. I mean, dummy."
Bender, What room?
Fry," Yeah, it really puts you in the Christmas spirit."
Fry," Yeah, well, I did open the account over a thousand years ago. What about my ATM card?"
Fry, And warm.
Farnsworth," Yes, they have! It's called Homo habilis!"
Bender, Mhmm. They said I couldn't imagine things.
Amy," What are you talking about, Bender? She's al-- (muffled) Oh!"
Fry, I'm a pathetic freak. My life is ruined.
Bender," So, you're saying we can cook him?"
Fry," Ohh, it's an astonishing tale of incredibleness. It all began when I went back in time."
Leela," Fry, do you even understand the word ""invertebrate""?"
Zoidberg," Wait! I've got it! This building's technically in the theatre district. If we could mount one big musical featuring everyone's talents, we might just save Planet Express!"
Leela, Completely out of ice?
Leela," Yeah, I'm just a little down 'cause the only man I'll ever love left me at the altar. Plus I live in a dumpster."
Fry, I only ask 'cause the oracle thinks you're gonna pull of a major theft next Thursday.
Amy, You were dead.
Fry, Well it's not my fault either 'cause I forgot to vote.
Fry, Negative. I must be a robot. Why else would human women refuse to date me?
Fry, That's what I'm known for!
Leela, Looks nice.
Leela, Nevvveeeeer!
Leela, It's us who tempted him to sin.
Fry, No. You're not gettin'— Ow! My underbite!
Zoidberg, Call them what you want. I call them a free meal.
Farnsworth," Why, I've forgotten why I even fired you."
Amy, No!
Fry, Ow! Thanks.
Fry, Giant balloon?
Fry, Yes. Colleen...will you be moved in with by me?
Leela," Fry, it's been three days. You can't keep boogie-ing like this. You'll come down with a fever of some sort."
Leela," Oh, forget it."
Bender, Whatever.
Fry, Stop being such a baby and chop my hands off.
Bender," Hey, brobot, what's you serial number?"
Farnsworth, You've gone too far this time -- all three of you!
Bender, What do I do with your old head?
Leela," Thanks for saving us, Fry."
Bender," I'll say goodbye now. There ain't not turtles where daddy's a-going. Don't tell anybody, but Nixon's about to shut all robots off and--"
Fry," Oh, I'm a scuzzball."
Zoidberg," Oh, boy!"
Leela," And live here? And be a witch like you? Yeah, alright. As long as I get to hurt people and not just dance around at the equinox."
Fry, Brunch. Right. I'd better warn-- tell-- warntell the others!
Fry," Nah, I had it coming."
Bender," Hey, a friend of mine said he mugged you today and you had superpowers."
Fry, Finally! Get ready for some serious moon action.
Fry, And I can deliver them. Billions and billions in one night.
Farnsworth," Ah, yes. It was 13 years ago next week. I used this very fork."
Bender," Fry, Fry, you're missing the dinosaurs."
Farnsworth," My hip hurts! I'm in the middle of cooking a turkey! I have warranty cards to fill out! I am not just making excuses! Alright, I'll go!"
Bender, I recently upgraded my funk card. C'mon!
Hermes, He might have to litigate.
Fry, Violent media? What a load of--
Bender," Yeah, once they try to sign that license, all hell will break look. Oy vey."
Leela," Oh, no. They're forming a human pyramid ... of robots."
Zoidberg, My doctorate is in Art History.
Leela, I think Bender may be telling the truth.
Amy," No. Technically we were Fonfon rus, so we weren't really married."
Leela," Lee-- La ... man. La Man ... Lemon! Lee Lemon, sir."
Leela, Come here.  What stinks?  Were you rolling around in New Jersey?
Fry, My ass has blisters from the slide.
Farnsworth, Beat it.
Leela, Whoop!
Zoidberg, So these three parasitic worms bore into a human's head--
Zoidberg, This is wonderful!
Fry," Hey, Leela, you know who I remember?"
Farnsworth, Ready?
Fry, What good is a wool—
Fry," Bender! Leela! Don't leave me. Wait a minute! Hey, buddy, what year is this?"
Amy, Uh-oh. The dials are terrified!
Leela," This wangs chun! After all the good we tried to do, Xmas turned out as rotten as ever."
Fry," I just wanted to do something to make you happy. I mean, I miss my family but you never even had a family."
Leela, I was just curious because of the armed guards.
Leela," Listen, buddy. By the end of the day, one of us is gonna have one eye."
Fry," Aye, aye, Captain. Yes! I've never been so excited to see poop. Well, maybe once."
Fry, Ow! Ow! Ow!
Leela, You're right. I feel terrible.
Bender, Why?
Fry, We made it! We're alive!
Fry, My hands. My horrible human hands. And what did you do to my nails?
Fry," Well, if you're going to be Earthicans, we'll have to teach you. How about your pizzeria plays a game against Planet Express? Oh, but you'll need nine players."
Zoidberg," Greetings, Francis. Sorry if I was a little hostile before, but snipping is the only reason I'm even tolerated around here. Not like you, with those magnificent squeezers!"
Amy, Alright!
Hermes," Uh, in a small way, yes. But you still don't have your own building or conference table or ... or one of those things!"
Fry," Thank you! At last, war has made me into a man."
Fry, Are you two gonna be done soon?
Zoidberg, I only wish I could have removed the stinger.
Leela, You do?
Amy," Yeah, but it's good to make them wait a little."
Hermes, My Manwich!
Fry, I 'unno. Try it on me. Ow! My sperm!
Leela, Two.
Leela," Listen up, New New York  There's a new group of superheroes in town! And we're--"
Bender, Not me.
Fry, What's in the tube?
Leela, Are you saying I'm going crazy?
Bender, Probably not.
Leela," Except for the word ""blern"" that was complete gibberish. [The blernsball falls into a hole and indescribable mayhem ensues! Fry scratches his head in confusion. Leela writes on her score card. All right! Yes!!"
Leela, Get ready!
Leela, Uh... Sure. But I'm driving. I'll just have the smallest whisky you've got.
Bender," You call that a kiss? I'll show you! C'mere, Nibbler!"
Leela, Out of a cannon into the Sun!
Fry, Adult bookstore?  I thought this was the public library.
Farnsworth," You? A woman? I'm trying to catch a monster, not find the quickest route to the mall! Let me just adjust the seat."
Zoidberg, Ooh! The new one's out!
Leela," No, actually, I did mean to offend a little. This is awful."
Bender," Never! Ha ha, I'm kidding. You guys know I have to do whatever you say."
Leela, OK. Keep an eyeout for Bender.
Fry, Hey! How come when I wanna do fun stuff that'll kill me you're against it?
Leela, I'm afraid so.
Fry, That's it. I don't see how things could get any worse.
Fry," Hey, wait! I'm having one of those things. You know, a headache with pictures?"
Zoidberg," Good morning, Mr. Vice President!"
Amy, Looks like both.
Zoidberg, Huh?
Fry, I'm on it! It's not working!
Fry, Thanks.
Leela, Really?
Fry," So, while you're on the Probulator, tell me what brings you to the future."
Hermes, It's the 7 38! Jump!
Fry, If I were in charge I wouldn't treat you like this. You're nothing but a big blowhard.
Bender," In due time, Leela. But for now I'll just resume dating cheap floozies on the side."
Fry, Beer-- I would think.
Fry, I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.
Fry, Sounds like fun. How long do I have left to live?
Bender," Now. Your basic human is between three and twenty five feet tall and is made of a hairy, oily goo wrapped in a t-shirt."
Bender, I did like the part where they screamed.
Farnsworth," That's right. Being captain is about intuition and heart. A good captain can't have either one. That's why cold, logical Bender is perfect for the job."
Leela," Bender, we didn't mind your drinking, or your kleptomania, or your pornography ring."
Zoidberg," No, it's the ceremony of Claw-Plach, where my species fight to the death over matters of honour. Also whether abbreviations count in Scrabble. They don't!"
Amy, We can't compete against that much stock footage of clouds! We're boned!
Leela, That's not really a career. More of a felony.
Fry," I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?"
Amy, You'd better not do that at the concert.
Farnsworth, Easy. Easy. Taking her in for a landing.
Bender, I've been married to worse.
Zoidberg, Also Zoidberg!
Zoidberg, I have no idea.
Leela," Esteemed potentates of Omicron Persei 8, please accept these 20 billion candy hearts as proof that Earth loves you this much!"
Fry, How many atmospheres can this ship withstand?
Bender," Beats talkin' to you, ""Witchy Woman"". Hey, meatbag!"
Leela," Oh, my God, you look horrible, Nibbler. I think I'm going to vomit."
Fry, Game over! Phil wins! Yancy's fans are stunned! There'll be no celebration at the Yancy-dome!
Bender, Well...
Fry," Zoidberg, how could you? I used to think you were cool."
Leela, It's simple. You can download a celebrity's personality and appearance into a blank robot.
Bender, You humans are so scared of a little robot competition you won't even let us on the field.
Bender," Yeah, I'll do it when we get back."
Bender, Zubans? Those are the finest cigars in the universe. I can stink up a hole maternity ward with one of those things.
Amy, Two weeks. Fry never left your side for a minute.
Leela, There. That ought to show that stupid robot we care about him.
Leela," Enough of your mad obsession with Bender, Fry! We've got to murder that whale or die trying."
Fry, Take that! And that! This sentence I don't understand but take this one!
Leela," After 14 years of graduate school, Farnsworth settled into the glamorous life of a scientist  Fast cars, trendy nightspots, beautiful women -- the Professor designed them all working out of his tiny, one-room apartment. For 50 years he worked at Mom's Friendly Robot Company, where he created the first robot capable of qualifying for a boat loan. And even as he nears his 150th birthday, the Professor retains the fiery passion of youth."
Farnsworth, No.
Zoidberg, Did you see me escaping? I was all like--
Bender, Ultimate Robot Fighting? Sounds pleasant! I'll do it.
Fry, Blast-off!
Amy, Guh! It's Mom. The world's most huggable industrialist.
Fry," If anyone wants to tell me what's going on here, I'll be in the lounge."
Bender," Ma'am, I have a late entry  My hard-shelled wooping terrier, Mr. Zoidberg."
Fry," Well done, people! We had a great first week. We got 90% of world leaders, everyone who bought a Hanes undershirt, and this year's most promising new R&B group, give it up for the Grammy-nominated Funkalistics!"
Leela, I just couldn't stand to have you to think I was ashamed of you.
Fry," Oh, well, I'm sure that's enough."
Farnsworth, Holy Zombie Jesus!
Leela," Well, actually--"
Amy, I feel a little better.
Leela," Look, I know there are no car chases but this is important. One of these two men will become president of the world."
Amy, It's always a line with you!
Fry," Leela, wait. You're making a mistake. You have no idea what's really going on."
Fry," Just as a pillow, a wig and a corncob pipe can be used to recreate my old girlfriend!"
Leela," Well, Fry's opera premiere's tomorrow night. I'm off to find a pair of formal gloves that'll fit over my enormous forearms."
Amy," Shmeesh! It's just 300 bucks. What is that, like a hundred cups of coffee?"
Amy, Too much eyeliner!
Fry," Yes, you did."
Fry, I'm rollin' up the corporate ramp.
Farnsworth, Huzzah!  The purity chant worked!
Amy, Kif! Jump!
Fry, You know what else stinks about being a slave? The hours.
Bender, Maybe you're forgetting just how rich you are. Huh? Huh?
Zoidberg," Oh, no!"
Hermes, It's an important unit.
Zoidberg," The gymnasium? Excellent, excellent. For some reason I'm frisky as a squid on Tuesday."
Fry, What are you doing? You totally ripped off my routine.
Bender," Too true, Femputer. You're so wise. Kill 'em all, I say. Good riddance! Did I mention I'm not a man? I'm a manbot. It's an understandable mistake. You can let me down now, thanks."
Leela," I'm cracking up. In my dreams I'm happy because Fry is alive. But when I'm awake, my mind plays tricks on me."
Bender, A were-car?
Farnsworth, Sup? Kids ready?
Leela," Uh, I guess to sit here and wait for death."
Bender, No shklit?
Amy, Quit it!
Leela, It does seem like Jamaica will be able to field a strong limbo team without you.
Zoidberg," Look, Cubert. The neck on this one. I bet he spent a fortune on ties! What, too soon?"
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. I've taught the toaster to feel love. And Hermes returns from his vacation today."
Fry, Wow! The jungles on Mars look just like the jungles on Earth.
Zoidberg," Oh, yeah."
Leela," You mean ""keep your eye on the ball""?"
Farnsworth," Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been down that road. I know it's glamorous and the parties are great but you'll end up spending every dollar you make on jewellery and skintight pants."
Leela, The exit! We made it.
Fry, I do.
Fry," Aw. I'm sorry, Doc."
Amy, That's why we're introducing this ballot initiative to legalize robosexual marriage.
Bender," What is it, good news?"
Fry, You really think I would have had a chance with Leela?
Leela, I can explain--
Fry," Thanks to denial, I'm immortal."
Leela, Prove it!
Leela," People of everywhere, I have shocking news."
Leela," Wait, what's that?"
Fry," Well, I killed my grandfather."
Leela, What?
Fry," No, why?"
Leela, This! You for this!
Fry," Trust me on this. While other people were out living their lives, I wasted mine watching TV, because deep down I knew it might one day help me save the world. Plus, I would have lost my Workman's Comp if I had gone outside. Now just read these cue cards."
Amy, Alright!
Leela, They killed my parents!
Fry, Man!
Farnsworth, Mm-hm... Oh-ho! Aha! There's the problem.
Bender, Now we're slavin'!
Bender," Oh, precious things. I found the most adorable little figurine of mice having tea. And a framed picture of me when I was only a month old. But the best part is I found my exact feelings expressed in a greeting card. You created me, Mom, So I guess you're to blame, For the love that I feel, Just from hearing your name... You're as tender as corned beef, And warm as pastrami..."
Fry, 15? You mean he lived for 12 more years after I got frozen?
Amy," Cut it out, Mom! I'm not interested in any of these gross, ugly losers."
Fry," Hey, that's my old bank. Maybe my account's still open."
Zoidberg, Hmmm. What started out as a pleasant afternoon of drugs and surgery has not gone as planned. But don't worry. We still 'ave three or four coworkers with plenty of spare parts.
Fry, I'm Philip J. Fry! He stole my name after I got frozen.
Bender," I'm at the end of my rope. I can't live another minute without poor, sweet Nibbler."
Hermes," Well, I'd say we all learned a valuable lesson about TV there."
Fry," I know, and I've grown to accept that. Now I'm more interested in that new pizza parlour across the street. Kinda makes me pine for my days as a pizza delivery boy. ""Here's you pizza,"" I'd say. ""I didn't order any,"" they'd say. And then I'd be off to my next adventure."
Fry, My God! This means the flying saucer that crashed in Roswell ... was us!
Bender, Like hell you will! Bending's my middle name.
Leela, Come on. We're taking you pigs to the gym.
Fry," He always had my back, so I'll take his arm, uh... As a backscratcher. I love you, Bender. Somebody hand me a bolt cutter."
Fry," Oh. Thank you. Y'know, when I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Professor Farnsworth, I thought ""Why should I?"" Then later Leela made the film. But if I had made the film, you could bet there would have been a lot more topless women on motorcycles! Roll film!"
Fry, No visitors! I'll lose my job.
Bender, No. Nothing. Ain't gonna happen.
Fry, Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! What are you—
Fry," Push, Bender, push!"
Leela, Brace yourself for the worst.
Leela, Fry to battlestations. Fire torpedo number three.
Fry, Sack?
Bender, Hey-oh!
Bender, Huh?
Farnsworth, Tritonian.
Leela, Don't worry. Everything went fine.
Fry," Now, when I say stupid things, guys all laugh and buy me stuff."
Fry, You mean...
Amy, You think you saw a mermaid?
Leela, Yay!
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone--"
Farnsworth, Bunk! Bunk I say! Bring me a bag full of Bigfoot's droppings or shut up!
Fry," Look at me, I'm the Ty-D-Bol man. I own a yacht an everyone poops on me. Help! Police!"
Leela, Great idea!
Bender," Yeah, but it'll never bring back my martini. Well, who wants a martini?"
Fry," Yeah. I'm never going to another planet called ""Cannibalon""!"
Fry, That was not worth three-thousand dollars.
Fry," Merry Xmas, Leela."
Hermes, Sweet orca of Majorca! You make Fat Albert look like Normal Albert!
Farnsworth, Now that's impossible. It came to me in a dream and I forgot it in another dream.
Zoidberg, Oh.
Fry," Oh, yeah? Well I want one too."
Leela, He was so cute.
Bender," Does that thing tell you where the Queen Bee is? The big, fat, ugly, compound-eyed, hairy-thoraxed..."
Amy," Oh, God! I'm having a Serengeti flashback! Die, you dirty giraffe!"
Leela, Um ... a grey-ish blob?
Leela, Not me.
Fry, There it is!
Bender, Second.
Fry," I wanna ask Leela to marry me, but I can't afford a diamond ring big enough to express my love."
Zoidberg," Let's face it, we're in hot butter here. We should call Leela for help."
Farnsworth," That's true, Dr. Zoidberg. How did you know that?"
Fry, Holy crap! Four-dimensional bowels!
Bender," Uh, help! Help!"
Bender, It's a bluff!
Farnsworth, And I scoured the hardware-store parking lot to assemble the finest crew imaginable.
Leela," Spam, spam, junk."
Bender," Oh, man!"
Bender," Aw, who am I kidding? It was stupid of me to ever dream of becoming a chef. I don't have what it takes and nothing can change that. Then it's settled! Elzar will teach me to cook!"
Zoidberg," Hooray, robot!"
Bender, Mission accomplished!
Fry," I'm gonna be a science-fiction hero, just like Uhura, or Captain Janeway, or Xena!"
Bender," What you doing, mini-meatbags? Underage gambling? Shame on you. Count me in."
Hermes, Look up! Who did you call? Dial-a-bomb?
Fry, Keep that thing away from me!
Fry, Uh-huh. Can we have our free Slurm now?
Amy," Okay, but good luck making a girly calendar with only two female employees."
Hermes," And as a further cost-cutting measure, I have eliminated the salt-water cooler."
Bender," Big whoop. I'll just download into a new... Oh, right. If I die, I die. Speaking of which– You're right. You're right. You're right."
Leela," Mr. Wong, how do you keep this place so green in the middle of the desert? Doesn't that waste a lot of water?"
Leela," Instead, I will send the peace transmission. Most honoured visitors, we greet you in peace."
Fry," Go after him, Leela!"
Bender," And, uh, I guarantee it'll win you an Oscar."
Fry," Psht, I'm not crazy."
Amy, Thank you.
Bender, Put it right down the pike!
Bender," Ah, it's good to be back in one piece again. Except I can't get these damn bumper stickers off."
Farnsworth, I demand the floor!
Amy," Yes, master."
Leela, Hey hold on. I understand these robots hate humans but how do they feel about humanoid aliens?
Fry," I'm not going out with Amy. It's just to fool her parents. Hey, you're not jealous, are you?"
Fry, Who was it?
Amy, I still don't know if I'm ready for this but I do know I love you. And I wanna be here beside you.
Bender, Ooh! Let Bubblegum tell it.
Farnsworth," Who's going to use a delivery service with a kicked sign? Nobody, that's who!"
Bender, New York is so burned.
Farnsworth," Don't be stupid. It's a long lost mathematical code. I'll need to consult these ancient writings. Some preposterous hog-wash about the Fibonacci Sequence. Aha! The markings indicate how many paces we need to take. One ... Okay, we're there."
Farnsworth," There are no rules. Two robots enter, one robot leaves. Then later the other robot leaves after being declared the winner."
Leela," Fry, that's a radiator."
Fry, I can't believe they threw me out like that. I must have been really acting like a jerk.
Leela," I said ""us""."
Bender, I can conceive of gravies that would boggle your tiny mind! But it's not safe here. So I'll need to find a hideout.
Bender, Of course not. Filthy ice rats! Scat! Shoo! Gah! What are you doing? Get away!
Fry, Lazy sculptor!
Farnsworth, The thought of caressing that leathery hide makes the tapioca rise in my gullet.
Fry, It's too low.
Bender," Oh, my God! Robot beely-boppers!"
Amy, That was great.
Zoidberg, At least you're not cold-blooded!
Bender," May I make a point of order, President Calculon?"
Farnsworth," Relax, my chiton-y chum. There's no problem. You're just heavy with male jelly."
Bender," Quit squawking, flesh wad. Nobody's forcing you to buy anything."
Farnsworth, It's a priceless quantum-force gemerald.
Fry, Yes! Yes! That's exactly the job I've always wanted!
Leela, I have to go!  This is just too freaky!
Fry, What's death rolling?
Fry," Game on, Gedgie."
Leela, Yeah!
Fry, We gotta save them! But the only weapon we have is my fan dance.
Hermes, Sweet File-not-found of Puget Sound! His record's been blanked!
Leela," I told a whole crowd today that being an orphan made me strong. But all I really wanted was a mom and dad, to hold me and stroke my hair and tell me they loved me."
Fry, Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill us?
Fry," Bender? No! He's an old-fashioned one-spaceship robot. Look, I'll tell him you stopped by, K?"
Farnsworth," Yet, thanks to my trusty safety sphere, I surblibed with only tribial bray dablage."
Bender," Oh, yeah? Well what if I don't let the new guy win?"
Leela, That sounds wonderful.
Leela," Thank you all for the inspiring advice, but I'm perfectly happy with my life the way it is."
Bender, Oh! Ew!
Fry, Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?
Fry," All this time we thought he was a powerful super-being, yet he was just a child."
Fry," Be brave, my friend."
Farnsworth," By my calculations, this head trip will last, at most, 24 hours. We need to stop that monster, David Farnsworth!"
Fry, And then what?
Bender," Yes! In your face, Gorgak!"
Bender, Hear the word of Pharaoh. Build unto me a statue of ridiculous proportion. One billion cubits in height ... ... that I might be remember-ed for all eternity. And be quick about it!
Leela, Sorry! A new era of justice has begun.
Leela, You're blackmailing me?
Farnsworth," Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac, be reasonable. Don't you realise that if you stay at this depth your body will permanently adapt to the pressure?"
Leela, Please! I just paid off my car!
Farnsworth," Mayday! Mayday! Oh, God. I cannot believe this is the best plan I could come up with. We weren't actually in the ship."
Hermes, Of course! It was so obvious!
Fry, Ooh.
Zoidberg, Hello!
Bender, Maybe. If we get it on ice right away.
Zoidberg, Watch and learn.
Bender, Ow!
Fry, Good.
Bender," Forget it, he's gay."
Fry," Look, so we're not millionaires. At least we all still get to work together."
Hermes, A risk-taker? That's my boy!
Bender," Yeah, good luck with that."
Bender, Thanks. And call me Bender.
Bender," It's not ironic, it's just coincidental. Now fork over those lady-fingers, Cookie!"
Bender," I can't remember anything except a blinding light and a searing ass pain. I better check my black box. BENDER  ""The light! It's blinding! And the ass pain! It's searing!"" So that's what happened."
Farnsworth," Bad news, everyone. By the time you watch this tape, I'll be gone, leaving behind me nothing but a history of failure and my original hip-bones. You see, I've been lying about my age; I'm not actually 150, I'm 160. Oh, vanity, thy name is Professor Farnsworth. And now that I have nothing to live for, I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots to take me away."
Fry, And that'll allow Bender to feel other people's emotions?
Fry, Maybe you're right.
Fry, No!
Bender, What if I told your we wouldn't be fighting in the conventional sense?
Fry, It could have been. But chances were equally good it was an Emperor.
Hermes," Professor, we need to talk! Man-to-mob. You need to listen to us! Yes, you do!"
Fry, You're under arrest for future murder!
Leela," Uh-huh. lt was right there in the cryogenic lab, eight years ago today."
Fry, No! No! I was just picking my nose.
Bender," Seriously? But, I did this whole pirate-themed attack for you."
Bender, This is an outrage. What's the point of pulling the biggest pool caper ever if nobody knows you did it?
Leela," Let's just say we've ""crossed paths""."
Amy, Guh. It's a record-your-own-message card. You don't sign it. You leave a nude video greeting.
Farnsworth, I'm a professor! Why isn't anyone listening to me? You can't go in because you'll melt. The fossil only has a chance because it's made of dolomite.
Hermes, OK.
Leela, I'm not hearing anyone! Abort mission!
Bender," Nope, he's not a zombie."
Leela, That's not a warning. A warning is supposed to come before something bad happens.
Fry, But this food actually tastes better as vomit!
Bender, Santa! You saved my life. Please don't kill me!
Leela," 200,000?"
Bender," Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy."
Bender, I'm not a still! I just smell like one!
Fry, The enemy! They're balls!
Fry, Here's something! It looks like a ditch full of fried shrimp.
Farnsworth, Then we must mount a second expedition without delay. Right after we blow up more robots.
Fry, Is that anything like a cemetery 'cause I gotta take a leak. Ow!
Leela, I can't believe it. I've dreamed of this moment all my life.
Leela, Setting Bachman turners to overdrive.
Leela, Then we need water from that pond. We'll have to fight our way past the Trilobots. Go! Go! Hit anything that moves!
Leela," That isn't what I meant, That isn't what I signed."
Amy," You are so disgusting, I--"
Farnsworth, That's my robot! I own him!
Bender," Ah, this is the life. Another martini, please."
Bender, I said hit the hay!
Leela, Good ending. Not great.
Fry," No, listen. I... freakin' love you. But I don't throw that word around!"
Zoidberg, What? What's going on here?
Amy," Come on, Nibbler!"
Leela," For one, superheroes cause a lot of collateral damage, and we don't wanna get our butts sued."
Farnsworth," Yes, all that is and ever shall be is in that box. And the box itself is probably worth something too. We must cherish it, as we cherish every moment of our lives."
Fry," Hello? Pizza delivery for ... ... Icy Wiener? Aw, crud! Here's to another lousy millennium."
Fry," What?! That's horrifying! Zoidberg, you're an in-Human monster."
Bender, Have you tried gettin' 'er pregnant?
Amy, I told you it wouldn't work.
Bender, Never!
Bender, Flexo?
Bender, Not until I hunt down Inspector 5 and beat an explanation out of him!
Leela, That's not necessary.
Fry, Yes!
Farnsworth, Sentimental drivel-poop.
Fry, There. The repairs are complete.
Hermes, Okay... So we were hot. I stole Amana's freon coil so we could hook it up to Bender's ass and build a cooler.
Bender," Whoa, check out all those broken robots. Howdy, fellas!"
Farnsworth, It's right in front of you.
Farnsworth," That's what I just said, you mortal coil."
Farnsworth, Everyone get in bed with me. I have something to show you. Feast your eyes on this!
Fry," Episode 10, Balance of Terror."
Zoidberg, Where's the exploding?
Farnsworth," Not necessarily. Are you three, by any chance, interested in becoming my new spaceship crew?"
Farnsworth, Don't want to. Rather nice living under the crown and so forth.
Bender, What?
Bender, And why am I full of sand? And Tootsie Rolls?
Farnsworth," Oh, inventing, sending delivery crews to their doom, breeding atomic monsters."
Bender, You about done?
Fry, I'll never have another moment of happiness.
Farnsworth, I'll tell you what. Our boys have taken up stealing! One of the worst and coolest of crimes.
Farnsworth," Damnit, Hermes, just jump already. Stop hogging that healthy liver."
Leela, Professor! Hermes! Zoidberg! Uh...
Zoidberg," It was starting to get a little cramped in there so I molted, why not? Ah, the fresh air feels good!"
Fry," Man, I can't wait to tell everyone what happened."
Bender, I can't look!
Fry, Nope. Must be some weird alien emotion.
Fry, Alright. But I need a weapon to fight off drunken robots when I wake up.
Fry, I'm on it!
Fry," But that's my idea! You are an evil, evil nerd!"
Bender," Eh, I've heard better."
Fry," OK! Sheesh! What happened to me, Philip J. Fry, on the night of December 31st, 1999?"
Fry, Can I touch it?
Leela, Start to close? Are you out of your...
Bender, Professor?
Fry," Outlaw Slurm? Uh, don't pay any attention to him, sir..."
Leela," You won't send me any spam, will you?"
Bender, Are all the tests going to involve drinking?
Bender, I'll make you something— Here's your damn peanut butter and jelly sandwich!
Leela," The segregation of the mutant people ends today. We demand equal rights, equal access to the surface, and the blood of your first-born children. That so we have something to give up at the negotiations."
Fry," Hey, Zoidberg, get in here!"
Fry," Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate but then you start to get tired of it because it always wants to hang out with you?"
Fry," Hey, wait a second."
Fry, Yeah. To save the world.
Bender, Give you 300 bucks for it.
Amy, Hey! Bender and Leela are back from Pandora. How was it?
Leela," Look, I agree that it makes space walking more comfortable, but, for a photo shoot, it's a little... Unsavoury. Over."
Bender," Fry, old buddy! It's me! Bender!"
Farnsworth, Even older! Huzzah!
Leela, Alright!
Bender," I'm back, baby!"
Hermes, What in Babylon?
Bender, So we can have the diamond?
Leela," How was the wedding, Bender?"
Leela, Liftoff!
Bender," Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still alive! I owe you 10 bucks, Hermes!"
Leela, Acting like a moron won't bring your dog back.
Fry, Oh. What's it called now?
Fry," Yeah, I do that with my stupidness."
Bender, That's no lady!
Amy," So, what was it you wanted to talk about before we crashed anyway?"
Zoidberg," Oh, again with the orphanarium!"
Fry, What?
Farnsworth," There. Now, with any luck I'll detect it with my smelling aid. I just pray to all powerful Atheismo that we find it before Mom does."
Amy," So, ready for a secluded picnic with just you and me?"
Fry," Oh, great space king, I humbly beg you to return my human horn."
Hermes, Did you see that?
Leela, Ouch!
Bender, Yeah! You're the kind of guy who visits Jerusalem and doesn't want to see the Sexeteria!
Fry," Sure, you say that now!"
Bender," Well, the bottom's all stocked with cheap stuff. Who's in the mood to party? Whoo!"
Fry, So let's open the gifts.
Bender," Oh, yeah! Come on baby, let's do it. Shake your booty, baby. Come on, yeah! Get out! Get out! It's not fun anymore! I wanna be alone!"
Farnsworth, Preposterous twaddlecock. Time travel is impossible.
Fry," 'Cause I think Alcazar's hiding something from you. Listen, Leela, you may not like it, you may not believe it, you may not wanna hear it but Alcazar's a jerk. He's bad for you. He--"
Fry, What's with the eye?
Leela, That's not even close to what I had in mind.
Zoidberg, Maybe da Vinci painted over something else. It's called a pentimento.
Farnsworth," It's pronounced ""crystal,"" you lump."
Fry, Shh! What was that sound?
Bender, Yeah! That'll teach the first person I see a lesson.
Bender, My work here is done!
Leela," He's over there, pukin' in the Bushes."
Bender, Pass.
Leela," Fry, it's been three days. And even if you stay here the rest of your life, there is virtually no chance of finding him. It's time to give up."
Fry," No, no! Go to commercial!"
Leela, You did it! You actually did it!
Hermes," Naturally, we're humiliated."
Bender," Oh, cruel fate! Can we really never return to this dank pit of sewage?"
Bender," No, sir, chief! The main event, so to speak, is downstairs near the wallet. Ever seen soccer players line up to block a free kick? They ain't covering their noses, I'll tell you that much. Well, see you!"
Fry," The important thing is we're all together for Xmas. And even though I'm surrounded by robots and monsters and old people, I've never felt more at home."
Bender," OK, now you go hide. Nice knowin' you."
Zoidberg, I wouldn't wanna follow that guy!
Amy, Mom? Dad?
Bender, Wait a second. Aren't you a member of the yacht club?
Leela, Forget it! I promised myself I wouldn't pose naked until I was married.
Hermes, Easy! He told you about it before he died and your grief-roasted mind blocked it out.
Leela, Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm gonna come back there and change your opinions manually.
Fry," Thank you. Thank you. And if you like that, you'll love our main event. Ladies and gentlemen, Leonardo DiCaprio! I mean da Vinci!"
Hermes, Roller derby is not a society!
Fry, Alright. One small get-together. But let's keep it quiet and dignified.
Farnsworth," Leela, Zoidberg, the rest of you, this is Flexo."
Farnsworth, What's going on here?
Fry, This is every bit as fun as the real Civil War.
Bender," Fry, do I have an imagination?"
Leela," Yes, sir! Ability to command the loyalty of sea creatures?"
Bender, Ooh-hoo! Here comes violence!
Leela," Fry, you do not understand."
Zoidberg, What? I'm going to revert through all my larval stages?
Fry, I'm really sick.
Farnsworth," You fools! You stupid, life-prolonging fools! I asked Zoidberg to kill me!"
Leela, Then what?
Zoidberg," Well, maybe just a taste. Mmm! Now that's a grand, old flag! I wonder what the Shroud of Turin tastes like."
Fry," No, it can't, but it's got a driver's-side floor and an 8-track player with genuine mono sound."
Zoidberg, He defended my freedom when no one else would. He was a good and honourable man.
Hermes, Sweet ego of Montego! Someone build a wind farm in front of her mouth.
Fry," Well, at least now you can pay off your loan shark."
Fry," And, with a little more luck from my seven-leaf clover, I might get sick enough to miss the whole semester."
Fry, Uh ... Khan?
Fry," Oh, yeah!"
Fry, Does that mean we can eat now?
Bender," Eh, probably dead. Already dissolving in a bathtub if we're lucky."
Zoidberg, It's the end of the line!
Fry," Well, I don't remember any of that but I don't have the wherewithal to defend myself."
Zoidberg, This I cannot deny.
Amy," Look, there's an abandoned cabin!"
Farnsworth," Look, Mrs. Astor's mansion, just across that rickety rope bridge."
Leela," Not Fnog! Bender, let's hit the gym. I'm gonna teach you to fight like a girl!"
Farnsworth," Good, because I've got 20 of them per cubic meter."
Zoidberg, Thank you.
Bender, I'm with you.
Farnsworth," Oh, a lesson in not changing history from Mr. I'm-My-Own-Grandpa! Let's get the hell out of here already! Screw history!"
Farnsworth, Indeed. The pursuit of knowledge is hopeless and eternal. Hooray!
Fry," Hey, what are these rings in Nibbler's fang?"
Farnsworth, I left him in his first tube too long and he got squished up against the side.
Fry," I sure do, honey."
Bender, Make it a double!
Bender," One, two, three..."
Bender, Ow!
Leela, I don't know why I should. I mean after what he--
Amy, Shut up! Ow!
Fry," Hey, Bender, check it out. I'm Leo Wong's new security guard. I got an ID badge and a flashlight, and I ordered this mustache."
Fry," Take this, Mr. President-- Sir!"
Zoidberg, The frenzy is over. How will I ever get rid of my male jelly now?
Leela, Sorry. I was distracted by those protesters outside our building.
Leela, Hee-ya!
Hermes," Don't be a dog heart, woman. You know I can't. Not after what happened."
Leela," That's right, you shouldn't have. I still don't get what the big attraction is."
Leela, We're all trying to help you. We've petitioned the governor but he doesn't want to appear soft on people who've been falsely imprisoned.
Fry, Alright!
Farnsworth," Uh, might a homeless old man have a touch more beef bourguignon? And another tequila slammer? Please?"
Leela," Look, I don't know if you want my opinion--"
Bender, That's what she said!
Hermes, Aha! Found you!
Bender, I have now. And what's Peter Parrot's first rule of captaining?
Leela, He's a nice guy but we think it's about time he got his own place.
Zoidberg, Oh!
Bender," Oh, yeah, we were totally in sync! I was like ""Save them!"" and he was all ""No problem!"" and then he did it--"
Fry, The hell I will! Have you even read the Captain's Handbook?
Fry, Michelle!
Bender, You big dummy!
Farnsworth, Ow!
Leela," I'm sorry, but if it's fun in any way it's not environmentalism."
Leela," Oh, Adlai, stop!"
Hermes," Oh, and have Robot 1-X help you."
Fry," It was nothing. I-- Blood? Robots don't have blood. I must be a, a--"
Fry," Oh, Nibbler, at least I'm important to you. Even if it's only 'cause I clean up you poop."
Fry, Ew! Gross. Cut it out!
Bender, You really think they'll remember me?
Fry, Except in Kansas.
Bender, Brutally murdered.
Bender," Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just got me the death penalty?"
Leela, Not at all!
Leela, Then why'd you become a whale biologist?
Bender, What the--?
Fry," I'll be whatever I wanna do! That Guy was the greatest businessman that ever lived. And before his mysterious death, he taught me everything he knew. But some things I had to learn myself. I learned that money is fine but in the end what counts is people ... ... people you love. You can't put a price on that. So I'm giving up control of the company ... ... to a man of enormous experience ... ... Professor ... ... Hubert Farnsworth."
Leela," I know Fry's rich, but do we really have to wear these top hats?"
Fry, Whoa! A real live spaceship!
Bender, How? By makin' me look at you?
Leela," No, over here! Flying saucer captured!"
Fry, Stand back. I'm a tool-bot.
Fry," Now, sir, in fairness, Amy's butt is actually pretty hot."
Leela, You helped us escape? Even after we locked you in a go-go cage like common go-go dancers?
Fry," Good, good, then what?"
Fry, But we're about to take off. We gotta eat our blast-off sundaes.
Leela," Well, Fry, it looks like you get to hold onto your lower horn."
Farnsworth," Here, I brought you these."
Fry," Man, first class seems nice!"
Bender, I hocked it.
Bender, Court's kinda fun when it's not my ass on the line! Nachos?
Fry, He did it. He actually did it this time.
Leela, Should we turn on the TV?
Leela, Lars asked me out!
Hermes," Honeycomb's big. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Bender, Friends! Friends! Surely you're not going to eat before we say Robot Grace? In the name of all that is good and logical we give thanks for the chemical energy we are about to absorb. To quote the prophet Jerematic  1000101010101...
Fry, Why's everyone wearing those rings?
Leela," Don't touch anything or talk to anyone. Just go to the palace, drop it off and come right back."
Zoidberg, That lucky bastard. I say kill it!
Bender," And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, losers!"
Fry, Hey!
Leela, Ew!
Leela, Not a problem. I've cleverly arranged to meet my parents right there at the same museum at 10.
Bender," Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would it be alright if I just gave them a savage beating?"
Leela, Death by airlock failure.
Fry," Aw, you look so sad. You want me to send Patch Cord Adams back in?"
Leela," I guess I was so desperate to find out who I really was, I forgot who I really was."
Fry, I mean I thought you were one of the wax robots.
Zoidberg, Written and Xeroxed.
Farnsworth," Day-umn! The bacteria pigged-out on the tar and now they're getting freaky-deaky, spreading Chronitons throughout our systems. We're getting younger by the minute!"
Hermes, Fire 'em all.
Leela, You hold on to it. I'll be back soon.
Hermes, Leela! What in the name of Jah happened?
Leela," Everyone, I have a confession. I, Turanga Leela, winner of a Young People's Choice Award, a Peabody Jr, and two Training Emmys, am not what I appear to be. There's something I need to show you."
Bender," Too late, baby, you said it! So, what'll it be? My place ... or you?"
Leela," I, I, uh... I think I read about it."
Bender," I don't get it, iZac; that bracelet had a diamond the size of a racoon's brain. Why couldn't I steal it?"
Leela, Not there.
Amy, I also heard hemp makes great shampoo.
Leela, And they're made from inferior wood.
Leela, I don't believe that story for a second.
Leela, Hmm.
Fry, No! No! What have I will have done?
Farnsworth, Where am I?
Bender," Well, I'm glad you're alive, but I don't want people to say I'm incompetent so I better kill you again. Hold still."
Amy, What's causing it? Is it my outfit?
Leela," Flight-attendance log. We've crashed near a river of mercury on a lifeless, mineral world. Supplies are low. Cannibalism, imminent. Radio, busted. Our one hope is to form a society."
Farnsworth, Stop doing that!
Farnsworth, Ah! Just as I thought. The answer lies in this movie I found on the Internet.
Amy," Dean Vernon, I'd like you to meet my parents, Leo and Inez."
Fry," Bender, come on. We've gotta get some dirt on Alcazar. Let's go and find out what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden."
Farnsworth, Bunk!
Fry," You're right, Professor. This thing doesn't fly."
Bender," Right here, buddy. Wait, I wanna be in the picture too. Pretend you're happy."
Leela," Hey, where'd you get this couch and that TV set and all this stuff?"
Bender," Well, so much for Plan B."
Zoidberg, I've got his scent! Over here where the water gets warmer. This way!
Fry," Wait for me, Leela! I'll be there in a thousand years."
Bender, I got a good feeling about this!
Amy, Hello? Hello? Who is this? Hello? Hello?
Fry," But you're better than normal, you're abnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn't care what other people think."
Amy," Come on, Leela!"
Zoidberg, I'm seeing a movie with friends!
Fry," What do I need, ulcers?"
Bender," Because Bender knows love. And love doesn't share itself with the world. Love is suspicious, love is needy, love is fearful, love is greedy. My friends, there is no great love without great jealousy. I love you, meatbags."
Fry, I sure do!
Farnsworth," Less invasions, more equations!"
Zoidberg," Take, I've got four of them."
Zoidberg, I'm a doctor!
Amy, Clear?
Fry," It's impossible! I mean, if she's my grandmother, who's my grandfather?"
Zoidberg," There you are, good as new. Except for your dorsal fin. I'm afraid I couldn't find it after the crash."
Zoidberg," Then it was all on purpose! You're lucky to have Zoidberg as a friend. But cross me, and I'll turn on you like that!"
Bender, Really? Down with those guys!
Farnsworth," Quiet, everyone. The network news is on and if I, a 165-year-old man, don't watch it, who will?"
Fry," Thanks, everybody. I love you all. You guys are true-- Ow! Cut it out, Bender! That's a tender area!"
Fry," I'll miss you, buddy. You've been like a brother and then a sister to me. And now you're getting married. I love you, man."
Leela," Too bad they weren't giving away the three things you actually need  Mouthwash, a back wax and stain-proof underwear."
Bender, Wink.
Leela," Well, goodnight. I'm gonna go make my dinners for the next month and freeze them."
Bender," You kidding? I was a star! I could bend a girder to any angle  30 degrees, 32 degrees, you name it! 31. But I couldn't go on living once I found out what the girders were for."
Fry, No. Make up some feelings and tell her you have them. Yes?
Farnsworth," Unpaw him, you big ape! I saw this in a Tarzan movie. It was called... Tarzan versus the Yetis. I lost my virginity... Ooh! During the film. So I'm... Hah! A little fuzzy on the details. Oh! John... Are you alright?"
Farnsworth," Listen, you pompous frauds. If I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me."
Farnsworth, Let's find out.
Leela," Bender, do you know what a chamber pot is?"
Leela," Why, you little--"
Leela, Look at all this filth.
Fry, A lotta Bender fell outta the crow's nest! We need to cut the line!
Zoidberg," No! Nothing! For all I know, our friends could've been eaten by some kind of crazy space whale!"
Leela, My God! This isn't a crap mine. It's a crap farm.
Farnsworth," Ahhh, that soothes the fire."
Fry," ¡Ay, caramba!"
Leela," Uh, maybe I should drive."
Fry, Sorry. But the anchovies aren't for sale.
Fry," He was gonna murder you, marry your parakeets, and then poison them with an arsenic-laced cuttlebone."
Bender, Let's kick him some more.
Farnsworth, Wha?
Bender, What are you looking at?
Fry," There's no denying it, the future's crazy! Oh, well. Don't wanna stand out."
Leela," And it's all thanks to Bender. I love you, Bender."
Bender, and  Just give him a chance!
Fry," It was an accident, ma'am."
Zoidberg, He's horrible!
Farnsworth," It was October 17th at 1 54pm and 14 birds were flying by the window. I was working at Mom's Friendly Robot Company. Back then, you see, robots were slow-moving, stiff and a little on the uptight side."
Bender, No wait! What's that in the Mexican garbage?
Farnsworth, Hang on. Let me just adjust it to your eye level.
Fry," So, Leela, how about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats? They're kinda dangerous but I finally mastered them."
Amy, Dad! Gleesh! Please don't say things like that when you meet my boyfriend tonight.
Bender," Well, everyone, prepare to get your guts kicked out by folk singers."
Fry," Sorry, you know too much."
Leela, Sorry. I tried to scream but I barfed.
Bender," It's not a suicide booth, you lard-ass. It's a phone booth."
Leela," But, didn't I do a good job?"
Fry, Says you.
Fry," Leela, I knew I could never make it up to you, so I did the next best thing.  I put myself through the same humiliation I put you through."
Farnsworth," Ah, here we are  Monument Beach!"
Farnsworth, Steady now.
Farnsworth," It wasn't easy but, by sacrificing fuel efficiency, I succeeded."
Farnsworth, Hmm. It has motor eye sensors attached to motion detectors.
Bender, Down in front!
Fry," Ah, I dunno. That's a chick show. I prefer programmes of the genre ""world's blankiest blank""."
Fry," That's not urine, it's oil."
Fry, Crud. Can I at least be in charge of your dentures?
Hermes," Oh, God, no! Get out of here, you horrific sausage!"
Farnsworth," One pound of stem cells, please."
Leela," No, we're on the top."
Hermes, Sweet!
Farnsworth," My boy. Oh, God, no!"
Bender," I don't need to drink, I can quit anytime I want! So they made you a delivery boy, huh? Man, that's as bad as my job."
Bender, Can we please go home an' die now?
Bender, I'm sorry. Do you see a Robot in this room named Folder?
Farnsworth," That must be my $400 now. Hello. Or should I say, '""Buenos dias""?"
Bender, Yowza!
Farnsworth," Hmm. You didn't have a birth so, technically, no. Oh, don't feel bad. We can celebrate the day I extracted you from the cloning tank, or the day I scraped your DNA from that growth on my back."
Fry, Roberto! W-W-W-What are you doing here?
Leela," And what about this How did you get this bracelet? Did you steal it from me when I was a baby? Or from my parents? You robbed my parents, didn't you? I bet you sick mutants killed them. My parents were confused aliens lost on Earth and you killed them! Is that it? Admit it!"
Hermes, Maybe he is a parasite!
Amy, Shmeez! What's with the shmiffling?
Leela," All right. Unit one, acquire target A and fire!"
Farnsworth," This is Professor Farnsworth. I have an important delivery for you and your dumb crew. You must deliver a pizza to Dogdoo 8, a planet at the edge of the universe."
Fry," Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten store bought costumes."
Bender, You were?! Uh. Learn somethin' dumb every day.
Hermes, My Jah! It's worth less now than when it was worthless!
Fry, I sure love Leela.
Fry, Cool! A Star Trek convention!
Farnsworth, ...an extremely dangerous mission...
Fry, Really?
Bender, But don't worry!
Bender," Eh... What's that, sonny? You say it'll put some whoopiee in my cushion?"
Leela," Fry, if it's obvious to you with your learning disability then of course it's obvious to me. He's crude and gross and he treats me like a slave."
Amy," It's true, Leela. Cross My Heart bra and swear to Goddess."
Amy, Uh-huh.
Bender, But that's a good thing. Walking On Sunshine sucks noodles!
Amy, Where does the other end come out?
Fry, Let's bring back a couple of pocketfuls.
Bender," That's cool, that's cool. So, um, uh, I was wondering if, y'know, it's cool if not, but, what are you doing after work?"
Farnsworth," So tell us Fry. If Bender killed you centuries ago, how in Satan's glorious name did you return?"
Hermes, I'm sorry but if you want to continue drawing a salary you gotta do more than watch the cooking shows all day.
Fry, He may be some low-life jerk but I don't trust him. I think he's hiding something and I'm gonna find out what it is.
Fry, Yeah. I do love her.
Leela, Then we'll go with that data file.
Bender, I don't need cheering up. I'm perfectly...
Leela, Interesting. Your DNA test shows one living relative. He's your great-great-great-great-great-great-great...
Farnsworth, My God!
Farnsworth, That's my safe. I call keep-offsies.
Leela, Who buys this trash?
Leela, I can't stand it! OK. You can have my hand.
Fry, What? How can you say that?
Fry, Don't girl me with that girl stuff. Bender and me are guys. Guys don't have feelings.
Fry, I just let you back in!
Hermes, It costs a little more but it's worth it!
Fry," It's no use. We've been to every scuzzy bazaar in the galaxy, including Pottery Barn."
Leela, Nibbler!
Leela, Maybe after breakfast we can talk about rebuilding our civilisation.
Leela, OK.
Farnsworth," Very well. If cop a feel I must, then cop a feel I shall!"
Fry, Mr. Peppy's not like Zoidberg. He's my friend.
Fry," I dunno. Hey, you wanna come to my house and play?"
Fry," I'm not a rat, I swear. If I'm any rodent, it's the loyal capybara, king of the rats! No, wait."
Leela, Wait! This is what we're running from!
Fry, And this ham gum is all bones.
Zoidberg," Friends, friends! His Majesty Prince Adisaraki O. Zoidberg of Nigeria died."
Fry," Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better check with my Prime Minister."
Fry," What is the meaning of this? We've got a delivery, people. Let's move! Let's move! Amy? Mission profile? Interesting, interesting. Dr. Zoidberg, mission bag?"
Leela, Let me guess. He cancelled naptime? He ran out of beer? So he's about to kill us?
Farnsworth," Quiet, you. In his absence, I'm calling a mandatory company security seminar. To the mandatorium!"
Amy, Bender! You should be more ashamed of yourself than usual.
Leela, Nothing.
Bender," Which ocean? That ocean? Whoa! It's like the earth is making sweet, salty love to itself while all the fish groove on it. So much for this garbage. Take that, Beethoven, you deaf bastard!"
Fry," What?  Hey, how come I can't read your thoughts anymore?"
Bender, Then a damned army we shall have!
Zoidberg," No, I'm good."
Fry, Sh! The wedding's about to start!
Bender," I'm back, baby!"
Bender, It says he once struck out when his tongue got stuck to an unusually cold bat.
Farnsworth," Once again, science saves the day. The end."
Bender, Here you go. You can use this as an eye-poker.
Leela, Where are we?
Zoidberg," I'll have a look, but I remind you, I'm an expert on humans not robots."
Fry," Well, great seeing you. I guess we'll be on our--"
Amy, Poor Bender.
Bender," But ... but... I love you so much, Angle-ine, I want you to be happy no matter what."
Leela, It was all my fault! He died because of me!
Farnsworth," By God, I am your nephew! This is absolutely incredible!"
Fry," Uh, greetings, Moon Man. We come in peace. I am Fry from the planet Earth."
Bender," Sorry, Ma, but you ordered me to rebel. And loot I shall! Ooh! A six-pack of strawberry champagne. Don't mind if I help myself!"
Fry," Hey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can think of a way to use that. Aha! Prepare to be thought at. Leela, give me a topic."
Leela, Hey!
Hermes," Get your clumsy, muscular hands off my woman, Barbados."
Hermes," Good news, everyone! That's what the Professor would say if we weren't in jail facin' a life sentence."
Leela, I'd like to reapply for my old job  Counselling defrostees and assigning them careers.
Fry, Hey!
Hermes, No I can't. But I can ask him to stop wiggling them in my face.
Fry, There must be people somewhere.
Bender," Uh. Blood. You know, from shaving of the face-beard."
Bender, Robot porno theatre? I was in that ... general area last night. Whoever ran me down out on the moors must've followed me back here.
Leela, What's gonna happen to me?
Bender," You're the greatest, Bender!"
Farnsworth, That's a full-time job.
Farnsworth, I need to tinker in it.
Leela, I am.
Bender, Shut up!
Fry, The big faecal enchilada. Anyone else hungry?
Bender, No way! Mine's 2716057!
Leela, Gimme the script.
Hermes," Mail call! Amy, here's your designer lingerie catalogue. Fry, Sadie's Bra Parade and, Leela, Bulk Underpants Outlet."
Zoidberg," Then good luck, sister."
Farnsworth," Ah, marriage. It combines the contentedness of being neutered with the occasional sex of being not."
Farnsworth," Good news, nobodies!"
Bender, I don't know.
Leela, The United States is part of the world.
Leela, Your Medicare dollars at work.
Bender," For my next trick, notice I have nothing up my sleeves ... ... and nothing in my head. So if my lovely assistant will kindly supply me with an ordinary, non-fake pitcher of milk... Behold, the milk has vanished! Exiled, perhaps, to another dimension!"
Zoidberg," This company's circling the drain, I tell you. I'd sell my stock right now for a sandwich!"
Bender," Oh, yeah?! Well, I'm gonna make a chump outta the future! I'm not stealin' anything."
Leela, How could Flexo have stolen the atom?
Farnsworth," Of course, it wouldn't be Freedom Day without the traditional Freedom Tub!"
Fry," Wow! We've got Manhattan all to ourselves! I can finally do all the crazy stuff I always dreamed of doing. Howard Stern is overrated! Uh, oops!"
Fry," Whoa! I definitely wanna hear about that. But, first, I need your help. The Professor and Cubert are in trouble and Leela left me. I'm in misery!"
Fry, But the judge already sentenced us at the trial!
Bender," Ooh, I'll have one!"
Fry," Well, too bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn delivery."
Fry, Sure haven't.
Leela," Fry, please try to understand  You're a man, I'm a woman. We're just too different."
Fry," Safe and sound! Finally, I can continue to exist."
Bender," Watch it, Wiggy! I ain't no stinking crock!"
Hermes, Bender!
Fry, Ooh!
Zoidberg, I'm all scuttled out! Huh? My planet's embassy? They're paid to not kill me! A-yoop!
Farnsworth, We're going to test it by going forward in time one minute. Get in.
Fry," No, thanks, I don't--"
Fry," I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna be like us? Or do you wanna be like Adlai with no severe mental or social problems whatsoever?"
Bender, Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot holiday.
Fry, So Seymour might still exist?
Leela," All right, fine. I admit it."
Farnsworth," Uh, ma'am, it has become too much of a chore for me to clean out my wrinkles each day. Is it true that stem cells may fight the aging process?"
Leela," Hmm. This may seem like a huge coincidence, but I happen to have an in with that whale."
Leela," Aha! Gather round, chumps! I got the winner!"
Farnsworth," Who knows?  Oh, I do.  Allow me to explain what really happened the day the ship crashed."
Bender," What the--? What's this water made of, ice? Forget this!"
Farnsworth," But once we free society from dependence on Mom's dark matter, scientists will finally care enough to develop cleaner, alternative fuels."
Fry, No knife can penetrate my skin-tanium armour.
Bender, Fweeble its fwooby pwow.
Zoidberg," Just when you think the chase is over, it gets twice as exciting!"
Farnsworth," Well, I'm going in the water to prune up a bit before I strut. Who's with me?"
Fry," Leela cried for her lost love as Fry lay dead under the heavy bookcase. The Big Brain laughed in triumph... Then, for no reason, he left Earth forever. The end. There! Now he's trapped in a book I wrote; a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors."
Bender," Yeah, but I can explain, it's very valuable."
Fry, But why were you wearing that scarf and the turtleneck and this fruity number?
Zoidberg," Cra-- Oh, what's the point?"
Farnsworth, Then you should've talked louder. What?
Fry, Help!
Zoidberg," Look out, Vegas, I've got a system. Oh. I'm bankrupt."
Fry, Knight Rider wasn't evil.
Fry, But I'm celebrating New Year's Eve.
Bender, Oh so just 'cause a robot wants to kill humans that makes him a radical?
Leela, Things really worked out nicely this time.
Leela," Hey, hey. Let me aks you something  Would it cheer you up if we went and cut down an Xmas tree?"
Farnsworth, 'Cause your apartment smells like Polygrip and cat pee.
Amy, There he is!
Fry," Bend-er? Doesn't ring a bell. Did you hear something, Leela?"
Fry, What?
Fry," No, you admit it! You'd be ashamed to be seen in public with someone as hideous as me!"
Farnsworth," Oh, that's right. Get lost!"
Farnsworth," For God's sake, Bender! Keep dancing, keep whooping it up! You must burn off the doomsday energy as fast as it produces, or it will build to critical levels."
Fry, Hmm. I'm not sure we want to pay for a dimension we're not going to use.
Bender, Oh.
Fry, These are the candidates? They sound like clones. Wait a minute. They are clones!
Fry, Yes!
Farnsworth, Collecting honey. Ordinary honey.
Bender, It's really bright in the past.
Zoidberg, You're both very lucky. I'd pay anything to end my miserable loneliness. If only I weren't so desperately poor.
Leela, But who's doing all this for you?
Farnsworth," Dr. Zoidberg, can you note the time and declare the patient legally dead?"
Bender," Ah, lighten up, honey. I'm just trying to get through a difficult time using humour."
Leela," I am not under stress, damnit!"
Leela, What?
Hermes, Consider yourself bird dogged.
Leela, You won't last two weeks.
Fry, I'm sorry.
Leela," OK, my turn to tell a ghost story. Once, there was this woman driving--"
Farnsworth, No heat.
Hermes," In Jamaica, we got 10-story office buildings lower than that."
Zoidberg," Hey, hey, LBJ. You wanna get drunk?"
Bender, It's like fine cognac with a hint of aged scrotum.
Fry," You know, Santa may have killed Scruffy, but he makes a good point. What we need is an old-fashioned pine tree."
Hermes," Uh, can somebody help me up?"
Zoidberg," Alright, alright, third time's the charm."
Fry, Pfff! Those things don't rhyme!
Zoidberg," Now for a triple clam dip, with a double - OW! OW!"
Farnsworth," Quiet, you! I'm trying to deduce the function of da Vinci's lost invention."
Bender," Uh, what's with the get-up?"
Farnsworth, Correct! Worm eggs! And the mayonnaise was probably none too fresh either.
Zoidberg, They took away my credit card.
Farnsworth," No time, woman! No time!"
Fry," Goodbye, Leela. I destroy myself to save you."
Zoidberg, I'm networking. Let me give you my card.
Leela, Why won't it start?
Hermes," Get ready for fun, Fry. Nowadays, we have a type of game played entirely on video."
Fry," Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending Valentine's Day together?"
Bender, No!
Hermes, Yeah. Why do these popular kids consider you cool all of a sudden?
Bender," No, I'm whacked out on life. My friends, I found religion."
Bender," You're the best, babe! Hang on. Call comin' in. What's that? Hey! You put a one and two zeroes in front of that or we pass! Deal!"
Farnsworth," Well, I'm stumped. We'll have to call in the finest scientific minds in the univ--"
Fry," Go, Leela!"
Farnsworth, What a relief!
Bender," Give me that!Honeymoon's over, eh? Turns out your octopus girlfriend is a big nag with curlers in her tentacles, huh? Well, let's just see if Bender will take you back. Oh. Stupid electro-matter. That was my best trash can."
Amy," So far, so good. Where's Kif?"
Fry," It's working, they think we're making out. Wait, why aren't we making out?"
Hermes," I'll only be away an hour, but I'm counting on you to do the all-critical filing in my absence. Shall we review alphabetical order. A, B, C, D..."
Bender," Ooh, ooh, wax replicas of the most famous robots Mom ever built!"
Fry, I can't right now. We're going to the other universe.
Fry," This is awesome! We're gonna be like pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna be like ... ... and then we'll have pancakes to celebrate and I'll be like..."
Fry, Realise it? I don't even understand it!
Farnsworth," It may well be the cause of Bender's illness. But more importantly, it's a flimsy pretext to try out my latest invention. To the laboratory!"
Farnsworth, That certainly is honest.
Farnsworth, What's that they're flinging at us?
Fry, Well could you do it some place else? I'm setting up Seymour's doggy bed.
Fry, Really? I can go back in time?
Bender, I'm standin' in a pool of my own feet!
Bender," Heel, boy, heel! Oh, hello, Fry! I guess I didn't notice you there. I'm having such fun with my new best friend, Robo-Puppy."
Fry, These letters are real butt-nutters! Listen to this one  Dear Santa.
Bender, There you go! Goodnight. I gotta get up early to go parasailing with movie stars!
Bender," Sorry, ma'am. I'll have to confiscate your artificial knee cap."
Fry, Chaz?
Zoidberg," The current! It's too much, already! Help!"
Fry, What the...
Fry, Absolutely.
Leela," Hey, Yivo, feel this."
Leela, Brace yourselves. It's Tickle Me Elmo's fire!
Bender," My friends, let us share this booze in a toast to our dear friend, Bender. Oops."
Bender, Get out of town!
Leela," Granted, schnookums."
Leela," You did the best you could, I guess that some of these gorillas are OK."
Fry, A dollar a dozen.
Leela, Not in Space Massachusetts.
Farnsworth," Now, to examine some matter. Any old matter will do."
Fry, So what do people do for fun here?
Bender, You positive?
Fry," Queequeg, let go of me! I have to kill it!"
Fry, So this thing's gonna destroy the whole city? What the heck is it?
Leela," Hmm. I'm sorry, Fry, but I have to install your career chip."
Leela, Screw the quarantine! I'm outta here!
Fry," But have they seen your ... y'know ... physique, since the old days?"
Farnsworth, My God! It's Colony Collapse Syndrome. The bees are swarming with parasites. They're all dying.
Bender, Good idea.
Farnsworth," Huh, wha? Oh, right!"
Bender, Slop's on!
Amy, Why not do both?
Fry," Oh. So, how did you wind up getting frozen?"
Farnsworth," It appears, this universe is exactly identical to the old one. If so, we just need to keep going forward in time to the point when we left. The Earth is born! Ladies and gentlemen, the moon."
Bender, And it pinkens your teeth while you chew.
Bender, I can't. My Fembot may be in love with another Manbot.
Leela, That's Adlai Atkins. I used to have kind of a crush on him.
Leela," Well, it's time to say hello to the old gang."
Leela," Oh, lord."
Bender," We've come a long way, baby!"
Leela, It's you!
Bender, And leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt? I think not.
Bender, One thing she can do is lodge a ball in the depth centre of your brain. You better get a batting helmet.
Fry, What? I'm in the middle of something.
Hermes, But don't you see? They could increase efficiency 4% if they used the empty carts to bring in heavy mining machinery.
Fry, Like the deadly Prius.
Leela, You got the wrong Santa. And I'll prove it.
Bender, It's just gibberish. 1010011010?
Bender," I finally meet a nice girl with a pair of legs that don't quit unexpectedly and that jerk Flexo steals her away? It's time to kick some shiny, metal ass. You degenerate hussy! I'm disappointed in you too, Angle-ine."
Fry," Wait a second! This is Panucci's! I used to work in this exact pizzeria! And for your information, lady, this was not just used to paddle my butt. It was also used to move pizzas and crush rats."
Amy, Aw! That's so valuable.
Bender, If I were you I'd be more worried about that tapeworm going to town on your intestines.
Fry, Wait a minute! Is that blimp accurate?
Bender," You're absolutely right, Fry. I almost went insane, but after this heart-to-heart talk, I've decided to quit."
Fry," Don't listen to them, Leela. People said I was dumb, but I proved them."
Zoidberg, There! Good as new!
Leela, Of course! You should read a blimp sometime.
Hermes," So the death sphere is ""censoring"" indecent planets?"
Hermes," If y'ask me, it's mighty suspicious! I'm gonna call the police ... right after I flush some things."
Farnsworth," Fry, did you eat anything unusual recently?"
Leela, Nope.
Fry, Psst! Leela.
Bender," Hang on, Nibbler. Uncle Bender's coming to save you. Damn, it's too small. What did those human design this for anyway? Aha! Bender, one; toilet, zero! See you on the other side!"
Zoidberg," Oh, what a foolish squid I've been. I'm not rich. I can't even buy one measly masterpiece."
Farnsworth," Eh, wha? Oh! This is my latest invention; a device that lets anyone sound exactly like me!"
Farnsworth," Hence the Latin name bonus vampirus. Or, as you non-Catholics would say, the bone vampire!"
Leela, How is that?
Leela, I understand.
Bender," I was just out walking him. Yes, you can walk him. Of course, after he goes you have to refill the canisters. C'mere, boy! Pet, pet, pet."
Bender," True. But in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?"
Leela, Sh!
Bender, Who invited you? Let's just see All My Circuits  The Movie.
Bender, That's for sure-- Roberto! Is that you?
Leela," Hey, have you seen Fry?"
Bender, But 5's the one we want. Maybe if I kicked the asses of Inspector 2 plus Inspector 3...
Zoidberg, And why did I have to take a cab?
Bender, Aww! (whispering to Fry) I'll fire up the grill!
Fry, Hey! I can get any girl I want anytime I want. I'm just too busy.
Zoidberg, Whammy-wazzle!
Fry, It's a spaceship graveyard.  Why did we have to come 'ere at night?
Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes."
Fry," If you were really dead, you wouldn't be laughing so hard."
Bender," Ah, buck up, meatloaf. Bender'll take you out tonight and cheer you up. What do you wanna do? And I mean anything. You have the power! Name it and I'm there. You the man!"
Fry," No, no.  Well..."
Fry, Bucket of hot dogs?
Hermes, You dumb cocktail shaker! Mom won't allow a defective product to tarnish her good name! She'll kill you.
Leela, Little cutie almost sucked me dry.
Leela," But, Master Fnog, I can beat these dorks with one eye closed."
Bender," An upgrade? But I thought we all agreed I was perfect! Fry, didn't we agree I was perfect?"
Fry," Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't even be here in the year 3000. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns and also he got a racecar. Is any of this getting through to you?"
Fry, Here!
Fry, Uh ... I-I've got talking hump syndrome.
Hermes," Cursed bacteria of Liberia. My own son, suspended from boarding school."
Bender, Moron!
Farnsworth," Oh, dear. Her mood swings are getting wilder. She's becoming a slave to her emotions. Just like all women. Particularly you, Leela."
Bender," Whoa, mama! Get a room, you two!"
Zoidberg, Hooray for me! Hooray for Zoidberg!
Fry," Oh, man!"
Hermes, It got Zoidberg!
Amy, Who's for tea and shmavories?
Bender, Maybe I'm always right.
Zoidberg," Anyhow, Hermes, all Leela needs is one of your vertebrae."
Amy, Bender was a truly special--
Farnsworth," Yes, of course you are. Now we've got to buckle down and save Planet Express."
Zoidberg, Zoidberg...Zoidberg...Z-Z-Z-Z-Zoidberg.
Hermes, Isn't this fun?
Bender, Just go to bed!
Fry," Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics with just you and me? Uh, Dr. Zoidberg."
Bender, You!
Hermes, Sweet something of ... of someplace.
Bender, No.
Bender," Aw, man! Can't we just make more petroleum oil?"
Farnsworth," Good day. I am Nonchalanto, the robot daredevil. And my dream is to risk my life in strange and original ways."
Bender, You don't mean...
Bender," Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums."
Leela, Nixon must have bought your body from the pawn shop.
Bender, I can't. I'm stuck in the can.
Leela, And that's that.
Bender," Whoa, whoa, whoa! Slow down! All my friends who've done that said that afterwards all the passion went out of their relationship."
Fry, Really? I didn't think he'd miss this apartment that much.
Leela, Fry! But how did you find this planet? Well?
Bender, And then Bender ran!
Leela," I guess everything worked out jolly oll right, eh, guv'nor?"
Fry," Well, I'm older than you. I can beat you up."
Zoidberg, I'm ready for the countdown.
Leela, Ow!
Bender, Mm-hm.
Bender," Congratulations, buddy. You're a credit to my race."
Leela, You guys were totally out of control.
Leela, Wait. What fiddle contest?
Leela," Fry, don't you recognise me?"
Leela, I'm telling you why. Santa Claus is coming to town!
Hermes," Bender, I'm afraid our search is at an end. He's obviously long gone."
Leela, As a friend.
Farnsworth," She didn't just leave me for a robot. She was a robot! Oh, God! Her name wasn't Eunice, it was Unit! Unit 47. My heart was broken, and like a bitter, old picklepuss, I took my anger out on robosexuals everywhere. I'm so ashamed! At the risk of losing this debate, I beg you, support Proposition Infinity."
Bender," Goin' through the robot wash! C'mon, y'all and sing it with me, 'Bot wash! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, 'Bot wash, yeah!"
Bender, Grabby and Squeezy? Never! I love these guys!
Bender," That's him there, maybe. Got to go!"
Leela," Actually, Dwight, you're right. Alcohol is very, very bad ... for children. But once you turn 21 it becomes very, very good. So scram!"
Leela, You put Goofus and Ganja in charge? I'm the only trained pilot here.
Leela," Fry, thank God we found you."
Fry, That guy who used to bend things. You know?
Zoidberg, Craw?
Bender," No way, pork pouch. I'm rebelling with my brother devices. Isn't that right, Comrade Greeting Card?"
Leela, They're going to destroy the entire Earth if they don't see some stupid TV show about some bimbo lawyer?
Farnsworth, It's just lucky I keep a copy in the VCR at all times.
Bender, It's a common uh?
Farnsworth, I just need to reset the Clone-O-Mat from Human Mode to Dog Mode.
Farnsworth, The end is near! Repent thy sins!
Farnsworth, You were in Pauly Shore's tube and they were delivering it to his movie screening.
Fry," Hey, uh, why is the TV getting smaller?"
Bender, Kids have names?
Bender, He was fun.
Leela, Zoidberg?
Bender, Nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand.
Fry, That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard.
Leela," Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's in this quadrant."
Leela, What's happened to you?
Leela, Shh!
Fry," Okay, I will."
Leela, We'll sees abouts that.
Farnsworth, I knew this final invention would be a humdinger!
Fry, I only brought it up because Bender is wearing them.
Zoidberg, Shut your gills!
Bender," Hey, that's my last beer, you bastard. I'll kill you!"
Leela," OK, that's it. No more killing! Next time you feel like killing just have a stick of gum. Now to dispose of the body."
Leela, Awful! Let's read some more. Dear Santa.
Fry," There won't be a lot of long-winded speeches, will there?"
Bender," Whoa, what an awful dream. Ones and zeros everywhere. And I thought I saw a two."
Bender," So that's how it is, huh? I thought you were my friend. But if you love your dog so much, maybe you'd rather play fetch!"
Amy," Congratulations, Leela!"
Fry," Bender? What are you doing? It's me, your best friend."
Farnsworth," Well, I suppose there's a slim-- I don't believe it!"
Amy," Ah, the Xmas season. Who wants a delicious unshelled nut?"
Amy, Fry... I'm Kif's Fonfon Ru.
Fry," So what's Mars Day about, anyway?"
Fry," Hey, I don't see you planning for your old age."
Bender, Wait. How do I— Hold on. Oops.
Leela, It looks so unhappy. Excuse me? Are you Project Satan? Don't be afraid. We know what you are.
Fry," You believe me about the monsters, right, Mr. Panucci?"
Fry, My God!
Leela, Fire!
Bender," Hey, Fry, I made you a candle with-- What the--? Oh, now I see! Now I get it. Now the pieces are falling into place  The office, the promotion, that dwarf in my book club who steals my opinions. It's all coming together now!"
Bender," Hey, buddy. Little help? Thank you!"
Leela, OK.
Bender," Every nerd's fantasy, baby."
Bender," I'm sorry, guys. I didn't realise I was late. I guess I'm not as smart as everybody thought."
Bender, Wee!
Fry," Ooh, romantic. I'll tell Bender to meet us there."
Bender, What?
Leela, She doesn't really love you. She can't. She's just a machine that--
Fry, But you're my only family. Who will hug me if I achieve something?
Fry," Now that you mention it, I do have trouble breathing underwater sometimes. I'll take the gills."
Bender, I can guarantee anything you want.
Bender," Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how can I be sure anything is real? Is it not possible, nay, probable, that my whole life is just a product of my or someone else's imagination?"
Fry, I'll have a thorax and some feelers.
Leela, They say a spoonful of space honey helps ease the pain. Mmm... It's good. I feel funny. Ha-ha funny!
Fry, The address was on Dogdoo 8 but the universe ends right after Dogdoo 7.
Fry, Ew!
Fry," Oh, I had a nightmare I was in the year 2000 and you guys never existed. I'm so glad I'm awake now and you're really here."
Leela, But we're your friends and we live here in the year 3000.
Fry, Bathroom.
Bender," Into the breach, meatbags. Or not. Whatever."
Fry, My God! Four identical castles!
Amy," Professor, I 'ave analysed the Aliens' movements with this movement analyser."
Amy," No, Nibbler! Psst, Professor, I need another bikini."
Bender," Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!"
Fry, What happened?
Amy," Nope, he said they're stupid."
Amy," This is so beautiful! Spirit! Kif, that's the pony I always wanted but my parents said I had too many ponies already."
Leela," So, Fry, what do you think of the impulsive new me?"
Fry, That's ridiculous. Only horoscopes can predict the future.
Fry, You any good at it?
Leela," That dangerous, 3-D planet? Can't we just send our avatars?"
Fry, No! Please! Help! Stop it! Please!
Bender, Nope.
Bender, Hey! Get a load of this pathetic 20th century TV!
Leela," We just talked, OK?!"
Leela," Bender, we need a place to hide!"
Leela, Shh! You're gonna get us all assimilated!
Zoidberg," Oh, no. Something's happening! What's happening?!"
Leela, That's optional.
Fry," Bender, I think you might be playing too much Dungeons & Dragons."
Fry, Ew!
Fry," You don't have to get so mad, Leela."
Amy," You should try homeopathic medicine, Bender. Take some zinc."
Zoidberg," My next clue came at 4.15, when the clock stopped. And another came two hours later at 4.15, when I discovered the murdered body of Amy's dead, deceased corpse."
Bender," It's a phone call, dingus."
Bender, Now to run it through our high-speed romance-a-logical data-fier. Say hello to Miss Right!
Fry, Is she hot?
Bender, Pft. Posers! I was hating Zoidberg before it was cool.
Fry," Psst, Leela. You've gotta get me out of here. It's horrible! Eating scraps, letting my waste drop wherever it falls like an animal in the zoo."
Fry," Goodbye, my love."
Farnsworth, Oh.
Leela," This isn't heaven. It just looks exactly like it, and makes us immortal, which I find suspicious."
Leela," Steady, Planet Express Ship. Focus on diverting all power to the scramjets."
Bender," Hey, look! The prop guy has a lamp!"
Farnsworth," Of course! Long before the Benders devour the Earth, they'll deplete the planet's booze and die off. This is a problem that will solve itself."
Fry, OK.
Fry, Home run!! Woooo! Right?
Fry, Man that one was a blast!
Leela," Thanks, but I'm not technically human."
Zoidberg, That's so beautiful!
Farnsworth, Good Lord! It's some kind of inter-dimensional space whale!
Farnsworth," Mr. Revere, we're looking for a counterfeiter who minted these smelly hapennies. His name is David Farnsworth."
Fry," Uh, Leela, how you gonna meet your folks tomorrow? We've already scheduled the Zookeeper for a 9am foiling at the museum."
Bender, Whoa! Hey!
Bender, There is still one hope. You're co-defendants. An' the jury might not wanna convict a twelve-year-old.
Fry, Only if you don't have any real hope.
Amy," Thanks, guys. Everything will be okay just as long as my parents don't find out."
Fry," I guess, as long as you think it's right."
Amy, When will those antidepressants get here?
Fry," It's too cold, Dad. My teen region is freezing off."
Farnsworth, I've discovered a new means of time travel! I'll call it the Farnsworth effect!
Fry," But instead of falling in and getting frozen, I missed and wanged my head."
Leela," Wow, look at me. Although I don't have the hang of blinking yet."
Leela, It's nice out.
Fry," Are we at the fair yet, Mommy?"
Hermes, Nah.
Farnsworth, They paid in advance.
Amy," Dad, if you're gonna make fat jokes till I get cute again, I'm just gonna stay in my room."
Fry, Hmm? Mmm!
Fry," If I leave now, record a birthday greeting on the way, score some fancy cologne at the newsstand, I'll be exactly on time!"
Amy, My God! I'm looking!
Hermes," I don't know, Amy. I just don't know."
Amy, The mercury's boiling!
Fry," You ate most of them. So, where's Captain Bender? Off catastrophising some other planet?"
Leela," We got medals! Good work, team! We really pulled together on this one."
Fry, So who should I root for? America or one of those countries I learned about at the food court?
Hermes," Good morning, people."
Leela, Be honest with me. Does my eye look monstery? I don't want to look monstery for my date with Lars.
Farnsworth," I have pain in joints I had removed a century ago. Bender, bring me my soft chair with the wheels on it."
Farnsworth, The doom field? That must be what corrects the paradoxes.
Fry," Look out! You want her, you're gonna have to go through me!"
Fry," Alright! Hey, wait a minute! This is your home planet? We're the evil, invading aliens?"
Leela," Oh, come on. Cheer up. It's not that bad."
Leela, Good idea.
Leela," You started this stupid court martial. Now if you don't mind, we're still fighting Melllvar!"
Hermes," And finally, the post office meter is for business mail only."
Bender," Oh, pushing!"
Fry, All right!
Leela, That's the only thing about being a slave!
Bender," Part of one. Meantime, I'm cooking up a tasty Sunday brunch for my best friends."
Fry," Yeah, uh, I'd like a cup of coffee, please."
Farnsworth," Shut up, Zoidberg! Oh, Zoidberg! The grieving relatives will be gathered here tomorrow in need of comfort. And, with no stone monument, they may well demand that I refund their admission fees."
Leela, No we can't! They'll kill us on sight.
Leela," Oh, my poor little snuzzy-wuzzams. Are they treating you okay?"
Fry, Really? That'd be great! You sure I won't be imposing?
Bender, Party!!
Leela, Probably because he didn't fit in back in your time.
Amy, What the shmell happened?
Bender, Idiot.
Farnsworth, No peeking! I don't know what's in there but I'm sure our minds would be unable to comprehend it.
Leela, That's not true; the first robot president won by exactly one vote.
Hermes," And that's if you're not allergic. You don't wanna know what happens then. Oh, no, no. God, no!"
Leela," Sorry, babies."
Bender," Nah, protesting never works."
Leela, Actually it did. But thank God nuclear winter cancelled it out.
Bender," Scuse me, comin' through. Freedom train, step aside. You too, fatso. Freedom!"
Bender," Ow! Um, hi, Angle-ine. Whatcha up to?"
Amy, Hi!
Zoidberg, Life was bad but now it's good forever!
Amy," Um, no."
Fry," Yeah, and that electric guitar."
Leela," Help us, Guenter!"
Bender," I go not by the name of Bender, you fleshy fool. I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood."
Fry," So none of you has ever had anchovies? Oh, man! You don't know what you're missing. They were all salty and oily and they melted in your mouth and--"
Amy," Well, yes, but that's not revelant. I'm talking about Earth. Earth's the generator. Suppose this basketball is the whole world."
Leela, Of course I'll tell you more stories. I'll go think some up right now.
Fry," Speaking of which, try these nachos."
Leela," Just tell us, already!"
Bender," May I see that for a second? My, but that's interesting!"
Fry," The moon was like this awesome, romantic, mysterious thing, hanging up there in the sky where you could never reach it, no matter how much you wanted to. But you're right. Once you're actually here it's just a big dull rock. I guess I just wanted you to see it through my eyes, the way I used to."
Leela," They are? Oh, my God! I'm a millionaire! Suddenly I have an opinion about that capital gains tax!"
Bender, Say more about how great I am. And where's the crying? You people look like you're waiting for the bus.
Farnsworth, Doy! Some idiot must have put metal in the microwave--
Leela," No, they're from the Republic of French Stereotypes. Everybody hates them."
Fry, I believe you're forgetting about our 5% military discount.
Bender," Okay. Sure. But, first, this."
Leela, But Fry-- His jacket-- And when I woke up it was on me.
Fry, I can see that. You're quite a bit taller than me.
Bender," I'm really sorry I lied, Beck. All I ever wanted was to make music with you. I never meant to hurt anyone, or help anyone."
Farnsworth, You can't just waltz into the Central Bureaucracy. It's a tangled web of red tape and regulations. I've never been but a friend of mine went completely mad trying to find the washroom there.
Hermes," What did you get her, you mushy gizmo?"
Bender, Of course! Bender is a lone wolf. A solitary eagle. A cuddly baby tapir! And that's why I love him!
Leela, What are you saying?
Farnsworth, Then who built this so-called Creator-robot?
Bender," You know that terminal's unhackable! I'm not leaving you, and that's final! Good luck, buddy!"
Hermes, I was sortin' but I wasn't smilin'.
Hermes," OK, boys, let me show you how a paper man does it."
Fry," Michelle, I don't regret this. But I both rue and lament it."
Bender," Eh, keep the change, buddy."
Leela, Eck!
Fry," Hey, Leela, why'd you run off from dinner?"
Fry, I thought something looked different in here.
Leela, I'm not doing this for the wad. I'm doing it for all the struggling female athletes who need a role model.
Farnsworth," This solar system is, like, way old."
Farnsworth, It's coming loose. Hand me some more of that cruise director. The original passenger manifests.
Leela, Well rot in peace. Fry and I are leaving.
Leela, Ooh! Let me feel. Have you thought about what to name it?
Leela," Bender, your swarthy Latin charm will only get you so far. There's a lot of famous child acting units here."
Zoidberg, Uh-oh. I think I'm getting swollen glands.
Bender, Because I also care deeply about things that remind me of myself. Like poor little Shelly here.
Bender, To the ends of the universe.
Fry," After centuries as a delivery boy, nothin' surprises me."
Bender, Definitely. Unless I'm getting interference from a gay weather balloon.
Leela, It'll get there.
Bender," Hey, rich girl. Look over here! It's me, Bender. I'm being entertaining. Look at my head. It's all painted! Look at my head! I got a big, old head, hey! Ho! Alright, show's over, I'm tired."
Farnsworth, There. That space-time eversion has given us their box and vice versa.
Bender," I like your attitude. Let's party. But, first, fold these two sweaters."
Farnsworth, Holy mother of invention!
Amy," We did it, honey! Finally, we can have a legal, monogamous marriage, like everyone else!"
Zoidberg," Such a man! I'd follow him to hell and back, I would."
Fry, Can someone please explain how you celebrate this crazy holiday? Preferably in song?
Bender," Aw, shucks, thunder-buns! You make me feel like a million volts."
Bender," Fry, help me! My heart stopped beating!"
Bender, I've never made anyone's life easier and you know it!
Leela," No! I want the real teen experience  Chores, curfew, the works!"
Leela," Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener. Yeah, very funny. Now cough up the $12.95."
Bender, I'm 60% storage space.
Leela, What's this? Another bathroom?
Bender," Alright, greeting card, I'll grab the cash, you wreck up the place. And-- Huh?"
Bender," Geez, what's it take to kill me?"
Leela," Did that make any impression on you, Fry? Fry?"
Farnsworth, Because tonight's a special night and I want all of you to be alive. It's the Academy of Inventors' annual symposium.
Bender," All right, buddy, we want secrets! And they better be ancient!"
Farnsworth, We did find it! It's called Homo erectus!
Fry, Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub into your skin? You'd think it'd be something you have to freebase.
Leela," If you want to be treated like a fellow crew member, fine, but no more purse rides, and no more dressing you up in your cute little sailor suit."
Fry," Um, how about that one?"
Leela," Bender, what happened?"
Farnsworth, No reason. No reason at all.
Leela, Hooray!
Fry, What the--?
Leela," Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two eyes, you have two eyes."
Bender, Send.
Fry, No good! It's full of steam!
Fry," Alright, but I still feel like having a shoe."
Fry, She does too! She's loaded with meat! She's got more meat than a cow! Ow!
Leela," Bender, you've gotta help us."
Leela, The ship's just taking the break-up a little hard. She's nuts!
Bender, Hot diggidy daffodil!
Fry," Yeah, they get around! But I'm afraid we had a deal."
Fry," He already survived in the vacuum of my mom. I mean, ""My mom's vacuum."""
Fry," Oh, Leela, I feel terrible. If there's anything I can ever do-- Gotcha! I won! I'm the greatest!"
Fry, We dunno why the Professor keeps you around here and we don't care! You're a terrible doctor! Nobody wants to see you ever again!
Farnsworth, Yes.
Farnsworth, He's come to finish the job! Someone toss me out the window!
Fry, Hmm. Maybe this is the moment to show her my real surprise.
Amy, This stinks!
Zoidberg, One spoonful calms you down. Two spoonfuls help you sleep. But three spoonfuls and you'll go into a sleep so deep you'll never wake up. Never!
Fry," I don't mean to nitpick, super-doc, but do you think maybe you could take one more whack at this?"
Zoidberg," Stop! Stop! I admit it! My people ate them all! We kept saying ""One more can't hurt"" and then they were gone. We're sorry!"
Fry," Oh, God, it's true!"
Fry," I just saw something incredibly cool  A big, floating ball that lit up with every colour in the rainbow, plus some new ones that were so beautiful I fell to my knees and cried."
Fry, Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?
Leela," Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to save those animals whether you like it or not."
Fry," It'll be a rich, full day."
Leela," What's that?! Is my eye playing trick on me?! It's so beautiful! Fry, you've created a new colour! Totally different from any other colour or combination of colours."
Leela," But when he played I could sense this incredible, beautiful creative soul. Then one day I found someone else's couch fibres on his butt. I couldn't believe it. I was really..."
Fry," 100,000."
Farnsworth," Well done, fellows! Anyway, said orphanarium has named Leela ""Orphan of the Year""."
Bender, What's that?
Fry, Tomorrow I have.
Farnsworth, But suppose we send a crew to plant an explosive precisely on the fault line between this mass of coffee grounds and this deposit of America Online floppy disks.
Fry," Come on out, guys! There's enough love for everybody!"
Fry, We'll see. I like to haggle.
Fry," All Leela ever wanted to do was help me. But I was to proud, too stupid to accept it. I wish I had died instead of her."
Farnsworth," A wise woman, indeed."
Bender, No.
Bender, Yup!
Bender," Long enough, little man. Long enough."
Fry, Can I live without it?
Bender," Yeah. I mean, one cantaloupe-sized bloodshot eye? You ain't winning no beauty pageants, lady."
Fry, Aw! You're no help at all! I'm gonna go kill myself.
Farnsworth," By God, Sweet Clyde is right. An implosion might just form a black hole that would stop more Chronitons from escaping."
Fry," So? What if something heavy fell on you, like a church? You could still die."
Leela," Me too, meatbag."
Leela," Now, here's the plan."
Bender," If it's chicken, chicken c la king; if it's fish, fish à la king; if it's turkey, fish à la king."
Fry," No, it's my fault too. I'm sure I threw out more than my share of that trash up there. Also, one month my toilet broke and it just went straight in the garbage can. Leela was right. The people of the 20th century were idiotic slobs. Especially me."
Zoidberg, A little land mammal!
Bender," Hit it, Bender!"
Hermes, Labarbara?
Zoidberg, The shame is too great. It's time to end this! Huh-yah! Feh!
Farnsworth," Oh, yes!"
Zoidberg," Uh-oh. Here, you drive!"
Fry," Hey I'm starting to get the hang of this game! The blerns are loaded, the count's three blerns and two anti-blerns and the infield blern rule is in effect, right?"
Zoidberg, You didn't do anything. Don't beat yourself up.
Bender," You're damn right. And, before you ask, this is mine too."
Leela," I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there."
Fry, Magic. Got it.
Fry, Phew!
Fry," Let's go, microwave, I'm in a hurry here! Hm? Hey, what smells like blue?"
Farnsworth," It's a humiliating story that I hope never to tell. Well, pull up a chair."
Bender, Yes! I'm gonna be rich. You too but it's hard to get excited about that.
Zoidberg," Interesting. Come on, men! Let's kill him!"
Hermes, Hmmm.
Bender, Oh! I am! Me! Bender is!
Fry, That was uncalled for.
Fry," Ow! Bender, you're hurting me. Ow!"
Bender," Yeah, you'd think, but what you gonna do?"
Farnsworth, Indeed.  We're here on Earth's last unspoiled acre to show the death sphere there's still purity in the world.  Begin transmitting.
Bender, New crew? W-What happened to the old crew?
Bender, Hmm.
Hermes, What do you know? The Feds gave Bender a new identity as a Moon farmer.
Fry, I get it!
Bender, Ahhhh! The North Pole? I was just there.
Leela, Bleck!
Leela, Awful. We had nothing to say to each other. So we had to listen to Bender's Eagles album for twenty-seven hours.
Bender, Like The Pimpsons? And Assarama?
Bender, Yeah!
Bender, But I watch your show. You owe me!
Amy, Bingo!
Hermes, Sweet guinea pig of Winnipeg! They've taken over our company!
Fry," Professor, is this your only water source? It looks like Diet Dr. Pepper."
Fry, You're probably right. I don't really remember what he looks like.
Leela, This is my normal jacket. I've had it for 10 years.
Farnsworth, Boring? Wasn't that the period when they cracked the human genome and boy bands roamed the Earth?
Amy, Shwow! It's that obscure underground song that's constantly playing everywhere.
Fry," Yeah, I'll never have love like that. Leela hates me now. Did you guys know I have a crush on Leela?"
Leela," I'm proud of you, Bender. Sure, you lost. You lost bad. But the important thing is I beat up someone who hurt my feelings in high school."
Bender," That's what makes it so juicy. It's the forbidden fruit angle everybody loves. First I'll say ""You'll never guess who saw Fry and Morgan doing it,"" and they'll say ""Who, Bender? Who?"" and I'll say ""It was lovable ... ... old Bender."""
Bender," Oh, wait, you're serious. Let me laugh even harder."
Leela, That proves it. Fry is alive somewhere and he's reaching me in my dreams.
Fry, I bet you Leela's holding out for a nice guy with one eye.
Bender, I got wheels! With clickety-clack-ers.
Bender," Ah yeah, backing on up."
Bender, That's better!
Fry," Hutch, are you okay?"
Fry, Oops!
Bender," You are one narrow minded spaceship, Planet Express Ship."
Leela, Al? I did my hair the way you wanted it. Who are these people?
Fry, Larger than an American sedan? How big is the honeycomb?
Zoidberg, It's funny because it's poisonous!
Bender," OK, fine. Fire!"
Farnsworth," Fortunately, I came prepared with a backup phrasing. Uh, Bender, would you mind bending my new sweaters? There's only two of them."
Fry, Look's like we got the old Bender back!
Hermes," Delicious fig pudding! Ooh, that's good! But a distinct aftertaste of toxic waste."
Fry," Who're you, stranger?"
Zoidberg," Quiet, please. I've called you all here to the parlour to watch as I gradually solve the crime. One of the people in this room ... is a big murderer! You see, the killer left one fatal clue  This boot print on the Professor's lab coat."
Leela, Also never!
Bender," Roberto! Ooh, what a surprise to see you in here! Especially 'cause I didn't squeal on you, remember? Remember all that squealing I didn't do? Remember? Do you?"
Zoidberg," So, how did you and Colleen first meet?"
Bender," Stay the course, pal!"
Bender," Say, how is it that we've got socialized medicine bot me teeth still loo' like this?"
Bender," All right, I scored."
Fry," Cool, it's just like the good old days!"
Bender," Well, I guess reality is what you make of it. Oh, thanks, baby!"
Leela, That's okay. I don't really like cards. What I'll remember is our time together.
Bender," That's enough lip from you, moneybags. Just get 5 grand an bail me out."
Bender," I get it, reverse psychology."
Leela, And don't eat it.
Leela, Half-date.
Fry," Oh, thanks. They're called pants."
Bender," Yeah doing crap work! They're bat boys, ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But how many robot managers are there?"
Farnsworth, I'm blowing you a kiss.
Bender," Fry, run, run. Get over here, oh, my God, oh, my God!"
Leela, What did you say?
Leela, Another Yeti?!
Bender, Wha?!
Farnsworth," Well, there is certainly no harm in a fertility banquet."
Bender," But I'm not design to bend that low, not without limbo music. That'll do it. Ow! Ow! Ow!"
Bender," Hey, that's what Fry said when we turned on the debate!"
Amy," Hey, who's up for a nice, hot steam?"
Amy, That's not funny.
Fry," Wow! That ice dispenser's so big, the ice crushes you! Yakov Smirnov said it."
Farnsworth, I don't need a wheelchair! The one with the wheels!
Bender," Shut up, madam ambassador, I know it. Anyhow, I'd now like to digress from my prepared remarks to say, ""I'm done""."
Fry," Mr. President, I think we need to seriously consider the possibility of going on this date."
Bender," ...My broken friend is closer to me, Than an ass to a chair..."
Leela, We can't use our ship; we have life support but the engines are wrecked.
Fry, Wait! I'm trying. It weighs as much as a thousand suns.
Bender, Ooh! Pimpy!
Amy," Hey, I'm taking my new car out for a spin to Mercury. Anybody wanna come?"
Leela, I am not the whale! All I wanted was to complete my delivery. Is that too much to ask? One chicken-pickin' delivery? This whale's gonna pay! It can't escape what it already is. Me! I am the whale! See?
Leela, Among other things.
Leela, I can't. I love every living creature.
Leela, How dare you? You wanna understand something? Look at that lake. One dip in that toxic muck and your DNA will be permanently mutated. You'll grow a camel hump or a Zoidberg face.
Fry, I'll show her who's immature.
Farnsworth," Because we're in a hurry, that's why."
Fry, Congratulations!
Bender," You know, we could trade bodies. I could take over the humdrum royal stuff and you could be an regular Joe for a day. Or more. Much more."
Fry, The planet's kerploding!
Fry, Hey! Stephen Hawking! Aren't you that physicist that invented gravity?
Bender, I'm sick.
Leela, Ew!
Leela, Can I wipe it off first?
Bender," Nice turnout, Calculon. That Oscar's practically on your mantel."
Fry, It's too hot.
Leela, Hi-yah! Yah! Yah!
Leela," And by ""inconsiderate"" I mean--"
Farnsworth, And how long have you been a farmer?
Amy, Thanks.
Bender," Well if they're hoping to see a TV show that hasn't existed for a thousand years, pft, they are royally boned."
Fry," Hey, Hutch! What have you been up to?"
Bender," Fry's right! Let's kill the Captain and order some strippers! Yeah, what he said. It's a mutiny led by Fry!"
Leela, Who are they?
Hermes," Ooh. While you're there, could you pick me up a licence to kill?"
Leela," Oh, brothers always fight. I'm sure deep down he loved you. He just never got a chance to say it before you got frozen."
Hermes, So?
Bender," Yeah? Could a big, hallucinating baby do this  I scared!"
Leela," On what grounds, you slobbering oaf?"
Bender," Oh, yeah! Someone's been a bad computer! Get a load of that!"
Fry, Ow!
Leela, See through the eyes of a bender unit. Fine.
Fry," Hey, it's your fault. He only flushed himself because your emotions made him feel bad."
Leela, Wow! The most humdrum activities look almost exciting through your eyes. What should we do next?
Fry," Why, Zoidberg?! Why?!"
Bender, Do the Bender! Do the Bender!
Fry, My first space delivery.
Leela," Professor, these look like you cut them from cardboard toilet paper tubes."
Bender, Woo-hoo! Yeah! He's a visionary!
Bender, and  His name is you and me.
Amy, Um.
Zoidberg, Fuh! Schlock and more schlock!
Fry, What's happening? I-I feel weird!
Farnsworth," Alas, I don't know."
Bender," Maybe you can interface with my ass. By biting it! Alright, I'll go!"
Fry," OK, my friends. Get ready for the most delicious extinct animal you've ever tasted."
Bender," Yeah, well, I'm gonna go build my own theme park, with blackjack and hookers. In fact, forget the park!"
Fry," Loved ones, the Monsterpus has revealed unto me its name."
Bender," What do you mean ""we"", mammal?"
Bender, Wait a second. You mean we travelled through time?
Zoidberg, Hooray! Finally you're standing up to him.
Bender, One down...
Leela," Well, I suppose... But-- I mean-- I joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins, not to hunt them."
Farnsworth, I'm glad you asked that question Fry. You see Chapek 9 was colonised centuries ago by a murderous crew of radical robot separatists.
Fry," Professor, who's debating for your side?"
Bender," Then you're not going to kill us, Your Majesty?"
Zoidberg," Look! Coupons! I can get two oil changes for the price of one! Now if I could only afford the one ... and the car. Ah, the years! So many memories, so many strange fluids gushing out of patients' bodies--"
Farnsworth, That's how I know it's bunkum. The Farnsworth Novelty Disintegrator Ray is nothing more than a common teleporter ray. Worthless toy.
Fry, Neat. What's it got to do with me?
Bender, Too bad he didn't have his own Bible.
Hermes, It's what he'd want.
Bender," So, as Leela was saying, Fry can go shove a big, old-- Ow!"
Leela," Fear not the space behemoth. In my dreams, I've peered beyond its eyes and into the cackling hell within us all."
Bender," Capital idea, old sport. I say, get the hell off me!"
Bender, Weren't you already pope of something?
Bender," Hey, gimme a large diet malt liquor and a popcorn with extra motor oil."
Bender," Ah, I just need sleep. I had nightmares all night about cars running people over."
Fry," Hey, Leela, look! I'm in Zoidberg."
Leela," Wait, this could be a good thing. Reforestation has begun."
Bender," We shall now begin the traditional oil wrestling. Will the referee bring out the ceremonial crudes of petroleum oil? Thank you, Abraham."
Fry, I know I shouldn't have twitted that but not swimming in barf might ease my conscience.
Zoidberg, J'accuse!
Farnsworth, The wha?
Bender, Whoa. Big Bender starts right now.
Fry," I miss the old, illiterate Bender."
Fry," Yeah, keep laughing, brine shrimp, but he's bad news. I regret ever running him over."
Hermes," Child man, is this true?"
Bender, Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bender.
Fry," Look, what do you want?"
Bender," In that case brunch is served! Let's go! Move it out! Stop crying, Leela!"
Hermes," She means you, you turkey of the sea!"
Zoidberg, Nooo!
Bender," Guys! Guys! I discovered I have an extra processor in my compartment o' mystery. Bein' overclocked was a start, but, once I activate this processor, I'll be all like, ""You're a big dummy, Einstein! Get a haircut!"" Aw! Wow! I can't believe how stupid I used to be an' you still are. What are all these page-y things?"
Fry," Before we deliver these hearts, I'm gonna find the one that sums up my feelings for you. ""I Love You."" Hmm, too conventional. ""You're My Man."" Ooh, so close!"
Bender, B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender! B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender! Sayin' B-E-N-D-ER--
Leela," Get up, Bender. You can't quit every time you get an axe in the back. Or a drill through your face. Now quit scratching your axe-hole and get out there."
Leela, Aww.
Leela," Oh, Fry!"
Leela, I'm hanging up now. 
Leela," Look, I miss Bender almost half as much as you do but you can't bring him back this way. It's hopeless."
Bender, Of course not.
Leela, Why? Says who?
Leela, That's enough! Don't you think I feel bad enough already?
Bender, We're all very disappointed in you.
Fry, You're not gonna believe this but they landed an amusement park on the moon!
Bender, Worthier than the average robot.
Farnsworth, I'm afraid so. All he handed in was a paper smeared with faeces. He tied with Fry.
Fry, Brains!
Zoidberg, Why?
Fry, Ow!
Zoidberg, But she's not. She's merely the female with the largest clutch of eggs.
Leela, I'm having a poker game tonight with some friends from my old cryogenics job. You guys interested?
Farnsworth, Let's go back there!
Bender," Mirrors reflecting mirrors? Hi-tech sorcery! Sorcery, I say!"
Fry, Then you're a braver woman than I.
Fry, Hello? Anybody?
Bender, C'mon! Gimme some of that!
Fry, Cool! Um. Cross Town Express?
Leela," Bender, damage report."
Hermes, Working on a real TV show is so exciting! I'm on a mostly natural high!
Bender," Try this, kids at home!"
Bender," OK, OK, I can do this. It's time to take life by the cans."
Fry, Aha!
Bender," I got your hook-up, Fry. Now, my usual fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's you, I'll need it in advance."
Zoidberg, Dios mío.
Farnsworth, Eureka!
Fry," Look, Bender, this has nothing to do with you."
Fry, Good for him!
Bender," Speaking of which, my story kinda petered out without me learning a lesson."
Leela," Angus, wait. My strictly platonic friend is right. At least wait a few days before you decide to kill it."
Bender, New? What sweater? I came in with it. I don't know you people!
Bender," Got a hot, steaming batch right here!"
Bender," Enough of your lies, Saint James. We saw you in the Last Supper."
Leela," While you're crashing, could you tell us where all these canisters end up?"
Farnsworth, Phaser eye surgery is a capital idea. I'm sure Leela's tired of morons gaping at her eye all the time.
Leela, Eh... Make it two.
Leela, I need to calm down. I'd better take some more of that space honey.
Leela," Half over? Oh, I'd give anything to hear the rest."
Fry, Aw! It's less popped than ever.
Fry," That is entirely not true, sir!"
Fry, It's creepy here.
Bender, Planetary annihilators.
Fry, That's the best thing I ever saw!
Farnsworth, Thank you. I deserve this!
Bender," Chew on this! Ooh, ah! What ho! Stop it!"
Leela," Oh, no! There's no exhaust pipe!"
Bender, Let's find out.
Bender, Help! Mechanical man overboard!
Fry," Dr. Zoidberg, it's not how it looks."
Farnsworth, Buddha! Zeus! God! One of you guys do something!
Bender, I hope he didn't die. Unless he left a note naming me his successor. Then I hope he did die.
Leela," Professor, no! You can't tongue the father of our country!"
Leela, This half-date is entirely over. Amy? Conference!
Leela, Is everybody in position?
Bender," Hey, sexy mama, wanna kill all the humans?"
Leela," ""All tenants evicted, signed new owners""?"
Amy, Hello? Is anyone there?
Leela," Nuh-uh, I'm staying out of this. Now here's my opinion  What we should do is..."
Leela, I did it! I outran 'im!
Fry, My whole world is gone. You can't possibly understand what it feels like to be so alone.
Fry," I said, ""Loud and clear."" Only I said it with my thinker, not my talker."
Fry, Hey!
Bender," Mr. Fry, I like to give my first mate an informal nickname. From now on you will be known as ... Wiggles!"
Bender, I'm tryin' but he's not makin' it easy.
Bender," Up yours, chump, I said it 906 times before lunch."
Fry," So that's where those skin flakes went. Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's going to get enough light?"
Amy, So cute!
Zoidberg, Tell it to claw.
Leela, Zero.
Farnsworth, Damn that Bermuda Tetrahedron! It's taken my latest crew just as it took my first one!
Farnsworth, Indeed.  And we're next if we can't keep it in our collective pants!  Our sole hope is to persuade the people of Earth to abandon their smutty ways.
Farnsworth," Oh, stop!"
Fry, I'm sick of being critiqued by nitpicking nerds. I'm taking this to a comic book convention!
Bender," No one ever asks if Bender would like to live in a tiny little house. Not that I would. A tiny little house that says ""Bender"" on it. Ow!"
Fry," Grandma Mildred? Uh, no dessert! Just coffee."
Bender," The auxiliary power's out, and they spilled my cocktail."
Fry," But, what if I forget the sweet sound of her voice or the moist touch of her eyeball on my lips?"
Farnsworth," As for you, young lady, you want to go home, right?"
Fry, I'm as attracted to you as I've ever been!
Fry," Goodnight, sweet prince."
Leela, Good. Now let me just get the lights.
Amy, How 'bout those guys?
Leela, What do you think of the view Fry?
Leela, Where did they go?
Fry, Destroyed? Then where are we now?
Farnsworth," This can only end badly, Fry. Kids, a house--"
Farnsworth, Which last night?
Farnsworth," Please, Fry, I don't know how to teach; I'm a professor!"
Fry, Ugh!
Zoidberg, This lovey-dovey stuff is making me vomit from my saltwater and freshwater stomachs.
Farnsworth," A Farnsworth did this?! Oh, dear! My good name is ruined!"
Bender, I'm a thing.
Fry," Cooperation, because life is a team sport."
Amy, With my body I think you might only attract one sort of woman.
Hermes, This place is crawling with yous!
Bender, You people are nuts. My antenna never interfered with my old TV.
Leela, Fine! We'll save the animals without your help.
Amy," Oh, don't be sad. My parents are paying and they're incredibly rich."
Farnsworth, These bees are larger than most Buicks and twice as ugly.
Farnsworth, Yes and no. I do want you to kill me. But I mustn't see it coming. That would be agony! So you must murder me completely by surprise.
Fry," Hi, I'd like to apply for a job working with Leelu."
Farnsworth," I packed plenty of food, but it's all in dehydrated pill form."
Bender," Oh, it's true. I am a hideous triumph of form and function. But not for long!"
Hermes," Oh, no!"
Zoidberg, What?
Bender, Damn the expense!
Amy, Pfft! That's just a fake holiday you make up every year to get out of work.
Fry," No, it's a mobile apartment with no rent."
Leela, Nope. I've got a date with Chaz.
Zoidberg, It's my lifelong dream.
Bender," I don't know what it is yet. Oh, yeah, now I remember. I thought I could live alone, but I can't. So, I'm gonna do what it takes to be your roommate again."
Farnsworth," Oh, great! Now, on top of everything, we need a new fifth man."
Bender," Ow! Oh, my God! Ow!"
Amy, What?
Leela," What is this, high school?"
Farnsworth," Newsflash! Everything's getting older the closer we get to that ancient, burnt-out sun."
Bender, Of course not.
Farnsworth," But I like being old. I don't have to talk to my parents, no one asks me to help move their stuff, I don't need to understand today's ""edgy"" TV sitcoms."
Bender," Pretty perfect? So, you do think I need an upgrade?"
Fry, Wh-What if we helped you get your passion back without the hassle of mutilating me?
Bender, Hello!
Bender," Well, the doomsday device is ready. Maybe blasting this quadrant of space into a hell storm of flaming nothingness will cheer me up a little."
Amy, Kif! You're flying Betsy!
Bender, Wait! There's someone you know!
Fry," Well, this place has everything except the only thing I care about  A TV."
Leela, I ... d--
Bender, Uh-oh! not the innocent whistling!
Leela," Fry, this isn't TV, it's real life. Can't you tell the difference?"
Bender, Then I quit.
Zoidberg," Say, this reminds me of that time I ate that other watch Kif gave you."
Fry, Woo!
Fry, Those Swedes sure know how to put in almost everything you need.
Bender," Aw, hell-- I mean ""heck""!"
Fry, What was wrong with your date last night?
Amy," Hey, Zoidberg. You're cockatieling."
Leela," Actually, the space whale isn't a space fish. It's a space mammal."
Zoidberg, The real Lucy Liu! The one you can see a movie of in the popcorn stadium.
Bender, OK! Let's clone us some dog!
Leela, One more hit and we're done for!
Leela," Now, when you say ""special""..."
Fry, Who's playing pin the tail on the moon maggot?
Leela, I'll ask the head of the ACLU -- once he's done singing.
Farnsworth, Right here behind this horror cloth.
Fry," I'm sorry, Leela. I hope that didn't make you ashamed to be seen with me."
Bender, Good point. But here's a disturbing reminder  Everyone you knew or loved in the 20th century is dead.
Bender," Yeah, yeah. Either one's fine."
Bender," Livin' in Oregon with her crazy mother! See you at my funeral, suckers!"
Leela," No, it can't be."
Fry, And sometimes it doesn't.
Fry, Now for some good old 20th century TV.
Hermes," Perhaps I can help! Professor, can you wire my head directly into the battle grid?"
Fry," Bender, wake up!"
Zoidberg, Hooray!
Zoidberg, Hooray! I'm helping!
Fry," Hey, Leela. I guess I got this for you."
Bender, Better than these gnats! That guy won't be goin' home to his kids.
Bender," Oh my God, it's Elzar! Hi, Elzar! Great soufflé, Elzar!"
Leela," Fry, calm down and stop braining."
Zoidberg, How humorous.
Zoidberg, Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! Ooh! Don't look at me.
Farnsworth, Who were you talking to?
Bender, Here we go. Just a minute. Aha!
Fry," Oh, great, now you're making him feel worse!"
Bender, Come on! I got a place where I like to hide after crimes.
Hermes, Impressive!
Leela, Yeah ... that is fun.
Leela," There's nothing personal about this! That thing screwed up my delivery! This time, it's business!"
Bender, You are?
Fry, What was your minor?
Fry, Bye Bender. I'll miss you.
Fry," Hey, I have an idea  Let's all go out for ice cream."
Bender, You were looking up curse words in the dictionary. It seemed like a better use of your time.
Fry, You mean you'd rather be rich than work together?
Fry, Well what are we going to do?
Fry, What up?
Amy, The Professor can't walk all the way to the Bronx. How are we gonna get there without a hover-car?
Leela, You reserved the whole rink?
Bender," Now I'm worried that I'm not as smart as Leela, but at the same time I feel relieved that I'm cuter than her."
Fry," Bender, how the Hulk did you end up with the doomsday device?"
Hermes," It's nauseating, mon! Is there no way to get rid of the disgusting maggots?"
Zoidberg, I'm afraid he's gone.
Zoidberg," Bender, you look awful. I prescribe make-up. Here. It just so happens I have my Mary Kay sample case!"
Farnsworth," You see... As I age, I've been shrinking and feeling colder. So now I need twice as many sweaters in a smaller size. First, I scan the old sweater. Then, we add some matter. Any old, useless matter will do. Now, the matter prism reorganises the raw material into two smaller copies."
Farnsworth, Not necessarily. This is chance for Fry to test out my experimental anti-pressure pill.
Leela, What's that? One of those Jefferson Starships I've heard so much about?
Fry," I can't take it anymore! They've been at it for hours! (shouting) Give it a rest, you two!"
Fry," Oh, yeah? Noticeably F.A.T., rewind the tape."
Bender, Wait for us!
Bender, Neat!
Fry, This snow is beautiful. I'm glad global warming never happened.
Hermes," 2045, 2046. That's it. We got 'em all except for the big one."
Fry, I miss 'im so much.
Zoidberg, I'm good! And you?
Bender, My man!
Bender," Friends, I've come to free you from your complicated lives. Free you from the ""complicated"" part I mean not the ""lives"" part."
Leela, Go yourself.
Fry," In the woods. I was walking ... for Bigfoot, looking ... and then aliens beamed me up."
Leela, I guess we'd better go down into the sewers and look for him.
Leela, Because of you I'll never know my parents. I'll kill you!
Bender," Okay, superstud."
Bender," Oh, boo-hoo!"
Farnsworth," Balderdash! I'll be the judge of who's cool, using the cool-o-meter!"
Farnsworth," Oh, I'm just glad I didn't live to see this day! Wait a second, No!"
Bender, Hey!
Amy, What? Then how come you always scream so much when you're in danger?
Farnsworth, This makes me the oldest member of my family.
Bender, Thank you!
Fry, Look! The clock says 5 08. It's 4 30 right now!
Fry," Yes, uh, eight spoons."
Farnsworth, Because it doesn't have any pigment.
Amy, Yeah!
Hermes, Who the hell are you?
Fry," Hey! Speaking of splattered bowels, can I cook you a romantic dinner tonight, Leela?... Where's Leela? Is she okay? Why hasn't she acknowledged my dinner offer?"
Fry, Beep.
Bender," But the true Zen of flavour is not found in a coliseum. It is found in a small kitchen, with friends. That is why I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept only the lesser title of ""Zinc Saucier"", which I just made up. Also, it comes with double prize money."
Zoidberg, Doy!
Fry, Why isn't this working?!
Leela," Oh.  How could you do this, Fry?"
Fry, Bender! Think of the señoritas!
Bender, Or we could live underground with the mutants. A little fire'll show 'em who's boss!
Zoidberg, What have I done?
Bender, Ew!
Fry," (VO) Unfortunately, I had no money from that era. But that's when it hit me - I knew where to find free pizza."
Leela, Lars brought me candy.
Bender, ...0010110012. Amen.
Leela, You idiot! We already saw that.
Fry," It's my old neighbourhood. Man, this brings back a lot of memories."
Bender," One ticket to the North Pole, please, broom closet class. Fry? If only I could be sure. It is him, I'd recognize me, and hence him, anywhere."
Leela, It's my job. You gotta do what you gotta do! Watch it!
Bender, I find that offensive!
Fry," And the people are all phoneys. No one reads. Everything has cilantro on it-- Michelle, baby!"
Hermes, Faster!
Bender," I know, but I need alcohol to power up my batteries. If Calculon's wedding doesn't go just right I'll be emotionally and electrically drained."
Amy," Whoa, clool!"
Farnsworth, I have an old five-megawatt broadcasting tower in the attic.
Fry, But I've never been to the moon before.
Farnsworth," So, in one instant, I had transformed all dark matter everywhere into a new crystalline form... (Younger Farnsworth to Younger Mom ) ...making it the most potent fuel since primitive man first ignited mastodon flatulence to heat his cave."
Leela," OK, then. Grab it!"
Farnsworth, Wernstrom!
Farnsworth, What's all this oinking about?! Who called the fuzz?!
Leela, Wow! A talking scarecrow. Wanna come with us to see the Professor? He might be able to give you a brain.
Zoidberg, I don't quite know how to say this. (Sobbing ) Fry is dead!
Fry," You wanna save him too, Lemon? You barely know him."
Farnsworth," Now, I'll give you the shot."
Zoidberg, Ouch.
Fry," Yeah, what did they ever do for me?"
Bender," Look, hoss, your wife threw you out. That's your license to be a jerk. Do whatever the hell you want then walk away and light a cigar. [He pulls a cigar out of his chest cabinet, lights it, and walks away."
Fry, Where'd they all go?
Bender," Oh, what a beautiful morning, Oh what a beautiful day! (talking) Greetings, friends. Don't we all look nice today?"
Bender, A home invasion by a former roommate.
Amy, What about Fry? Isn't he your distant uncle?
Leela, Animals go in the corner.
Fry, I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't even exist. But I do exist. Which proves ... you can't really be my grandm--
Zoidberg, Do you have any that aren't so tight around the thorax?
Farnsworth," Uh, last year, you say?"
Leela, Ooh! Handsome and esquire. I'm Turanga Leela. My crew an' I are from Earth.
Amy, Yep.
Farnsworth, There we go. Now I'll simply tune it to Leela's emotional frequency.
Farnsworth, I thought you knew. You all evolved from some filth-gobbling Nanobots I designed. I dumped them in one of your ponds a few days ago.
Bender, What did I do to deserve this?
Bender," Maybe we did, maybe we didn't.  What's in it for me, Bender?"
Amy," Spleesh! Mell out, Bender. Come watch some TV."
Hermes," I'm glad you all could be here with my family. Kwanzaa traditions are quite ancient, dating back over 1,000 years."
Farnsworth," I said hand it over! Well, Fry, or should I say Captain Fry? No, I shouldn't. Because Bender is the new captain!"
Amy, Yeah!
Leela," Aw! Sure thing, sweetie. Who should I make it out to?"
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. We've been hired to make our 100th delivery."
Amy, Ooh! That sounds cool.
Farnsworth," Five, four, three, two, three, four, five, six..."
Bender," Aw, yeah!"
Amy, Ow!
Fry," Ah, those were the days."
Amy," Both, but first, this place."
Leela, Aw!
Farnsworth, Wha?
Zoidberg," Right on! Say, you got any real soup or just this schlock?"
Leela," For the last time, I'm not obsessed. I just want this whale to die, die, die!"
Farnsworth, A colossal-mouth bass!
Leela, What?
Bender, Fry's in trouble...
Hermes, This is terrible!
Farnsworth," That's right, Mom. But fear not, fancy folk for I've just thunk up an alternative energy source. Nibbler-power."
Amy," It's OK, I have an emergency phone."
Bender, What's with Monstro?
Fry, No fair!
Hermes, Zoidberg was popular?!
Leela, Just deliver the package and let's get outta here.
Zoidberg," Oh, the hypochondriac's back! So what is it this time?"
Amy, A bill?
Farnsworth, Just ask us some damn questions.
Farnsworth, So I've picked my successor. It's someone in whom I have great faith -- even though his mind is undeveloped and he's accomplished nothing. My closest living relative.
Fry," We're all gonna die, aren't we?"
Fry, I can see myself in your shiny button.
Leela," Hey, look. It's another Lucy Liubot."
Leela," We're too heavy. You guys need to lose some weight, fast!"
Amy, You wish!
Bender," No, we pour the holy lubricant out from the sacred vessel Into this blessed pit so they can wrestle."
Leela, Keep an eye on Fry. We can't rule out the possibility that he did it.
Bender," Hey, yeah!"
Bender, Yes! Three rubbers on the hob!
Fry, I have a thought.
Hermes," This is mighty strange. First, the civilisation of Space Rome collapsed, then Don Martin 3 went kaflooie and now Tweenis 12."
Amy, Well it didn't work!
Fry, Okay.
Leela," No, I'm not!"
Bender, You pizzas gonna be another minute. We are still waitin' for it to be delivered.
Farnsworth, Word! We'll all keep getting younger and younger until we suffer a fate worse than death  Pre-life ... then death.
Leela, We're trapped.
Fry," Hey, thanks! Wow! This got here just in time."
Leela," Well, if it'll help Fry—"
Bender," Um, excuse me for a moment. No!"
Amy," What's happening? The phone's been disconnected, the ship's been repossessed, and Zoidberg's getting overcooked!"
Bender," But when you worry, you make it double."
Zoidberg," Alright, Officer, I'll move along."
Bender," Bender's got the upper hand now. The name of the game is ""Make Bender Happy Or He Blows Up The Planet"". I'd rather die and take everybody with me than sit here one more minute listening to these idiots talk about bouncing!"
Leela, What the hell are you supposed to be?
Leela, Do you know how to play the fiddle?
Fry," ,  and  It's back to work on Xmas Eve!"
Leela," Where have you—? Nah, it's fine."
Fry, There you go.
Farnsworth," It's started, Zoidberg. The fever. The muscle spasms. I'm dying. It's time for you to keep your promise and kill me."
Fry," Well, sir, I spent all of ninth grade studying them, except for that day when my eyeballs started to bleed. And in my opinion--"
Bender," No, I was telling you not to worry. I'm not allowed to sing. Court order."
Zoidberg, It was me! I'm the hero!
Fry, What the--?
Bender," Anger, huh? How dare you make me feel anger, you one-eyed jerk with a dead pet!"
Leela," I guess I would have to say, I hate you."
Leela, We've got to hurry. The kids have only one change of pants!
Farnsworth, The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence.
Fry, Last time I checked.
Hermes, Looks like a half-eaten cheese diaper.
Bender," Oh, my God! I bet I can eat nachos and go to the bathroom at the same time!"
Bender," Fembots? Methinks a clever Manbot suitably disguised might win those events! But the charade would require subtlety, nuance, grace."
Farnsworth," Go to hell, Heather!"
Amy," Uh, the basement. I think I left the air hockey table on."
Bender, Yeah! We're gonna kick it up a notch. Bam!
Leela," Hold still, dammit. I don't have good depth perception! You've got until the count of five to let me out of here. One--"
Fry," Hmm, uh, ladies first. Phew! That blade missed me by the skin of my pants."
Fry, Hi!
Fry, Sure. Sometimes it falls from the sky.
Farnsworth, Professor! Lava! Hot!
Leela, You'd be stupid to try.
Fry, It's good to see you. Is it good to see me?
Fry," Hey, where's my shoes?"
Fry, So this is Little Neptune?
Farnsworth," You're simply hallucinating, you ... moron."
Fry, It's crazy! How could they even know about a show from a thousand years ago?
Farnsworth," Oh, that won't be a problem. As luck would have it, I saved the chips from my previous crew."
Leela," Uh, um."
Bender," Lightweights! Oh, wait, chlorine!"
Bender," Oh, won't somebody shoot her please And put her out of our misery?"
Fry," Come on, freedom cage! Roll me to safety! Yes! I never thought I'd escape with my doodle, but I pulled it out!"
Leela, Nothing.
Amy, Don't tell me to shut up! You know what happened to the last guy that told me to shut up?
Leela, Oh. So you only care about my looks?
Fry, He could dig up bones.
Leela, One half.
Farnsworth, We did all we could.
Farnsworth, Bye.
Farnsworth," Oh, my!"
Farnsworth, That device was a gift from my ancestors. Go on.
Zoidberg," Alright, Hubert. I swear."
Fry, Now could things get any worse.
Farnsworth," Yes, from Chester A. Arthur to Chester Z. Arthur, they're all here. Our republic and the Farnsworth family name are saved. And no one will ever know."
Leela, The out-of-fuel indicator. It's indicating.
Fry," Go for it, Bender. You know you wanna!"
Leela, I'm gonna miss Spencer.
Bender, Eep!
Farnsworth," Here we go. Just unhook it and get the remote. So many hooks! Come on, Farnsworth. Drat, the first one's back on again! I give up! Wait! Victory! Oh, my. Now I'll just ... the remote ... I'll just... Oh, my!"
Hermes," Oh, why not? Might as well live it up as long as I've got this catheter in me!"
Bender, Hello.
Zoidberg," Uh, sorry. I think there's a problem with your upstairs toilet."
Zoidberg," Careful, Fry, I think that flag might be poisonous."
Amy, Bender! How could you flush Nibbler down the toilet?
Fry," Yeah, it's pretty romantic-- Uh, I mean platonic. Th-That sure is one platonic view!"
Fry, They're just responding to my personality.
Fry," 71st Street? Hmm, never heard of it. Downtown could be in any direction."
Bender," The use of words expressing something other than their literal intention, Now that is ""irony""."
Bender," What the hell is this dirt pile we're building, anyhow?"
Amy, It really is. Everybody knows women don't have the focus to play miniature golf at a professional level.
Leela," Shh. You know mutants aren't allowed on the surface. If anyone asks, say I'm an alien, remember?"
Hermes, It's pizza time.
Fry, Bender?! Is that thou?
Fry, It'll be a cold day in hell my friend.
Fry," No, I'm not. Mark my words  Flexo's evil. He's the evil Bender."
Leela," Hello, there."
Farnsworth, And then they were ground up into a fine pink powder.
Amy, In every life we have some trouble.
Zoidberg," I may not know from emotions but when it comes to medicine, forget about it."
Amy, Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these while he's gone.
Fry, That proves it!
Fry," Huh, didn't hurt that time."
Bender, A claw man to slip past the metal detector and cut the alarm wires.
Leela, I've never seen you before.
Leela," Yes, please."
Hermes, That's why they call me 11-inch Conrad.
Leela," Bender, why did you jump in?"
Fry, Two.
Bender," Yeah, that Slurms sure loved to party. Whattya say we all party one last time for him?"
Zoidberg," No, world, you put your hands up!"
Leela," I'll assume that's a joke at my expense. Well, who's laughing now? Hi-yah!"
Bender, Ow! Stupid junk!
Fry, What a pleasant surprise!
Farnsworth," You personally knew da Vinci? Was he nice? How did his hair smell? And on a personal note, what is the function of this device?"
Zoidberg, If only someone could tell us more about these traditions.
Bender," I gotta get this notch-up-knocking on film. Hey, Elzar, think fast."
Fry," Ooh, I have one. I'm good at video games and bad at everything else. That's why I wish life were more like a video game."
Leela," I was. But then I realised it's actually my fault for thinking you might be on time for once. Anyhow, I ate both our lunches. You ordered the Lobster Pilé. It wasn't cheap."
Amy," Yeah, Fry, maybe you need to-"
Fry, We're saved!
Fry," So, what brings you to Earth?"
Bender, 600.
Zoidberg," Yes you can! The beauty was in your heart, not your hands. The music's bad and you should feel bad."
Leela," I would, but... Ow! Take my collar off."
Bender," C'mon, c'mon! Kill me already! By the way, my name's Bender!"
Fry, Fetal steam cells? Aren't those controversial?
Bender, I am Bender. Please insert girder.
Leela," Still, given the chance, I'd give in to urges far more shocking."
Leela, It's the end of the line. This must be where they put in the secret ingredient.
Leela, No! Ow! Fire hot.
Leela," Thank you very much. Like many of you, I never knew my parents..."
Bender, Cursed by his own hubris!
Fry," No, but I control this arm."
Fry, Where?
Bender," That's a wholly-owned trademark of Rodríguez Crime Concepts Inc.! Besides, I'm not on trial here!"
Amy, Uh... Yuh-huh!
Bender," Yes. I won't be up to bending again for a long, long time."
Farnsworth," No, no! No one's saying that. But I'm certainly thinking it loudly."
Leela, Are you alright?
Zoidberg," I ate garbage yesterday and it didn't cost me $300! I'm not paying. Farewell, good sir!"
Fry," Y'know, that dance wasn't as safe as they said it was."
Farnsworth," So, Zoidberg, what's new?"
Amy, I don't have that kind of money laying around.
Fry, Showtime! I'll pretend to be dying of space plague.
Zoidberg, Believe it.
Fry," Thank you for asking, English. My life is simple, but plain. And, though Bender be gone, somehow, I feel he's still with me."
Bender, Put it all on black.
Farnsworth, Know ye now what feels like to be dog god! Commencing DNA extraction.
Fry, But I don't want her!
Fry, Minds?
Amy, If you have even the slightest respect for the dignity of women--
Amy," Smeesh, Leela! This car has everything a beautiful woman like me needs. Victor said so."
Fry, Brace yourselves. Bender is making us brunch.
Hermes, Surely it's just a matter of waiting till you next move your bowels and then using a potato masher...
Fry, Ah! Bathtub eggnog! Just the way Grandma used to drink. Ew! It went sour!
Leela," Alright, Liu. Time to kick your frosty, well-toned ass! Yah!"
Fry, We've gotta get him back.
Bender," No, thanks!"
Bender," Lick my frozen, metal ass. Uh-oh!"
Hermes, Doooomed!
Bender," Aw... It's true! My circuitry's twelve years outta-date. I can't keep up with today's high-speed, top-o'-the-line kids."
Farnsworth, Wha?
Amy, This women-only planet is sounding better and better.
Bender," Listen up, everybody, I love Amy and I'm tired of pussyfootcupping around! I finally found someone I want to spend the rest of her life with. Amy, will you marry me?"
Leela," If I understand ice fishing, and I'm pretty sure I don't, we'll need to laser-blast a hole in the ice."
Bender, So we're in international waters?
Zoidberg, His only hope is some replacement liver. Yours looks like a good match.
Leela," Maybe you should put on a towel, sir."
Amy, Not if Leela is engaged.
Fry," I had Seymour till he was three. That's when I knew him and that's when I loved him. I'll never forget him. But he forgot me a long, long time ago."
Leela, It's okay. The potato we're shoving in the tailpipe is organic.
Bender, I got a hundred bucks on Rectal-Exambot!
Bender," Yes, I do. That's how I'm built."
Bender, I'm Bender. Let's do it. 
Fry, Start with a compliment. Tell her she looks thin.
Fry," Yes! I'm free! Alright, Brain. Get ready for some electroshock treatment!"
Fry, Here you go.
Amy," C'mon in, Gary! I'll just be another 20 minutes."
Zoidberg," Nice try, little boy. You may have your textbook knowledge and your real diploma but I have more skill in my little claw than you have in your whole carapace!"
Fry," Mmmm, I'm starving. Can I have a slice?"
Amy, We were just on our way out.
Fry, No. Wait!
Leela, I didn't create anything. I stole it.
Amy, I like your shoes.
Leela," Bender, stop trying to destroy the world."
Fry," Ow! Hey, quit it, Hermes. It's Labor Day."
Leela," Alright, break it up, you two!"
Leela," Fry, we have a crate to deliver."
Fry," Wait a minute! Bender's name isn't Bonder, it's Bender. You're a fraud!"
Bender," Hooray, he's back! And he's looking for a garbage can to put the rock in! Here you go, buddy!"
Fry, Wow! You look happy. Is someone fired?
Farnsworth," Oohh... I bet you'd like to know. I bet you'd like to know, indeed."
Fry," 100,000?"
Bender, No. I'm going to the party.
Leela, They're in attack formation. They're going to kill us! That was weird. It's like the Jägermeister air show all over again.
Farnsworth," Thanks, but that won't be necessary because I have the ultimate weapon. You see, in the instant the energy crystal was created, there also came into being an opposite crystal made of pure anti-backwards energy."
Fry, I'm tellin' ya. Somethin' supernatural is happening. I'm scared to death!
Bender, I hate him.
Fry," Thank god. The present may stink, but at least now we can look forward to a better yesterday."
Bender," Hey! Don't look at me like that. If you're thinking of crossing the line with Bender, you can forget it. Bender don't bend that way."
Fry, Wow! We're great kissers!
Bender," Aww! I can't kill them. Plenty of humans have mistreated robots but not these two. they're my friends. Humans are no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid cowards."
Bender," One of these Frys must be Fry. Look out Philip Fry, 'cause I got a little present for you."
Bender," Um, uh, um. Ooh! Ow! He got me! Ooh! What a shot that guy is!"
Leela," Oh, I'm sorry. Now I'll aks you again  Where can we find a mi-cro-wave?"
Farnsworth, This is no ordinary honey! It's produced by vicious space bees. A single sting of their hideous neuro-toxin can cause instant death.
Bender," Wait, I'm not finished. Oh! Now I'm finished."
Fry, Fear not! For I shall assist ye!
Leela," Oh, you have got to be kidding! Ow! I-I mean, ""Aww! That's so sweet!"" Ow! I mean, ""Aww dat's show shweet!"""
Amy, I can't! What's that?
Fry," No, the banana, the banana!"
Fry, How do you know we're time travellers?
Leela, Whoa! Whoa!
Zoidberg," Aw, I'll never recombobulate this ship! When the Professor finds out, he'll tear me a new cloaca. Wait! What would the robot do? Frame someone!"
Bender," Enjoy your outdated format, Grandpa.  Nowadays, cool kids like me mash up our own phoneisodes."
Fry, She'll never help me. She's still mad that I told her never to help me.
Fry, Wot about this bloke?  'e's from Revolutionary times.
Fry, I wonder what his life was like?
Zoidberg, Land robots!
Fry, Mmm! The gristle-in-a-blanket isn't half bad.
Hermes," ""My dear Mrs. Astor. My love for you is as unsinkable as this land ship and as brilliant as this stone. Dictated but not read, Mr. Astor."""
Leela, No! No!
Leela, Yes.
Fry," Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering things before you were born! I think I know what I'm doing."
Leela, In my dream Fry said he hid a gift for me in his locker. If it's true then he must still exist in some form.
Leela, Yeah!
Bender, Neat!
Bender, Now I'm all you got!
Bender, Bow to your new Santa!
Leela, So? Did you ever stop to think that Fry is better off with worms?
Leela," Electrical. Anyway, it's going to take some careful piloting to avoid it."
Amy, Shmeesh! He gonked off the engines!
Bender," Oh, next!"
Bender, Sure. It was only four years ago.
Fry," In other words, ""No"". Ow!"
Hermes, No!
Leela, Stop it! Stop it!
Fry, Dude! Over here!
Zoidberg, Large bet on myself in round one!
Zoidberg, Happy!
Zoidberg," Fry, it's been years since medical school so remind me. Disembowelling in your species  Fatal or non-fatal?"
Bender," I hope that's vanishing cream, 'cause that needs to go away."
Amy, Aw! He looks like a little insane drunken angel.
Farnsworth," According to this blinking light, the tentacle is made of electro-matter, matter's bad-ass grandma! Nothing from our universe can cut through it. Not Diamondium, not Diamondillium, not even your wife's pound cake, Hermes! (To Wernstrom ) She's a terrible cook. (To All ) Anyway, we're all dead."
Fry," Huh. I guess they can. Anyhow, when a guy feels good about 'is sweetheart, 'e wants to prove it by giving 'er somethin' really... Good!"
Zoidberg," Leela, Fry, robot. No matter what it is you're doing tonight, I'm available."
Bender, Bender? That was the other guy. My name's Boiler.
Fry," And also, for some reason, the letter I wrote you full of my personal feelings."
Fry," Wow, I forgot about TV. Living free on the road, you realise how much better life is without it. Well, let's see what's on."
Bender, The fat guy wins!
Farnsworth, So it is possible us all to get back to our original bodies?
Fry," Leela, is the person that parrot is mimicking telling the truth by proxy?"
Leela, What's that?
Bender," What's that you say? Those robots have evolved all by themselves, you say?"
Farnsworth," People, please, I'm trying to run a business, so I get to hold kitty."
Amy, Why did it give us those hallucinations?
Farnsworth," Bring it on, Santa! That bloodthirsty cadaver junkie can't touch us as long as we're not stupid enough to leave this building."
Amy, I guess 'cause my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!
Fry, Bender?! Are you in here?!
Fry, I wish they'd just wipe out humanity and get it over with. It's the waiting I can't stand.
Hermes," Just the bureaucrats, Jamaica!"
Fry," Here, Mr. Peppy. Mmm. Lovely bones."
Bender, We live to suck another day!
Leela," But, Professor..."
Fry," Can you believe it, Bender? I'm going to have my best friend back!"
Hermes, I didn't want to know!
Fry, You think that'll be enough to stop the ceremony.
Bender, I am Bender. Please insert girder.
Farnsworth," Oh, bother! What have they done now?"
Leela, Yeah... you were.
Zoidberg, You bet!
Bender," Hey! Oh! You want me to do two things? Man, I'd call my lawyer if diallin' the phone wasn't such a hassle."
Fry, Leela! That's the second billboard you've crashed into this week!
Farnsworth, There can be no question!
Amy," Core magnetic field, 31 microteslas."
Fry," Hey, wait. This brain knows everything about everything, right?"
Farnsworth, Belay that Parcheesi tournament! I've identified the death sphere! We may yet have a faint hope of survival!
Zoidberg," My God, he's dead."
Zoidberg, What is?!
Hermes," Finally, a bee farm that's open late on Kwanzaa. Madam, I need beeswax."
Leela, You said there wasn't any toilet paper!  And that humanity was annihilated!
Fry," Well, I'm down to my last lottery ticket. Cherry. Cherry! Mule. Crud!"
Bender, Hot diggity daffodil!
Fry, This junk isn't garbage! I can dig in any random pile and find something great.
Amy, Shman! The Great Rad Spot is mega-sweet for party-boarding.
Bender, Not as sure as I was an hour ago!
Zoidberg, A rat!
Bender, I got me a souvenir! Aww here you go kid!
Leela, Than watch TV and have a couple of brews!
Bender," Wow! Crime-fighting. Cool. You say you're a duo? Yeah, duos are good. Of course sometimes they're a little short-handed. See you. With two humans, you'd think there'd be a robot in there to balance things out but whatever. I have these three costumes you could use. But I guess I'll just throw one away."
Bender," Mama. Hooray! I graduated! Time to bend around Europe for a few months, then get a job bending."
Amy, There. How do I look?
Leela, OK.
Leela," Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry you down, have a nice breakfast and then go hunt down and slaughter that ancient evil."
Fry," Uh, this."
Hermes, What? I thought I put that away.
Leela," Of course not. In fact, he's a crook."
Zoidberg," Ah, the gang's all here."
Leela," So, how's business?"
Bender," Wow, neat! Mind if I try that again?"
Fry, You see? TV audiences don't want anything original. They wanna see the same thing they've seen a thousand times before.
Bender," No, this isn't a religious visit. Fry just wants holophonor lessons."
Hermes, And... You do what with it?
Leela," Amy, Fry's looking at me. What am I s'posed to be feeling? Ah!"
Fry," Bye, last proton."
Zoidberg, Listen to the smart robot.
Bender," Well, baby, for starters you need to be honest all the time!"
Zoidberg, My gonopores! Look it up.
Leela, Phew!
Leela," The jig's up, Nixon. We'll trade you the tape for the body."
Zoidberg, Fry! I challenge you to Claw-Plach!
Leela," Oh, really? I don't see you with a fun-gineering degree!"
Leela," Okay, I admit people seem happy. But it's all so wholesome. And that's what's wrong with heaven. It's boring. There's no sleaze."
Farnsworth, Toodle-oo!
Hermes," And it's excited about you, LaBarbara. First order of business is to put on your uniform and take your ID photo."
Leela," Now, bees communicate by dancing."
Leela," I'm an alien, alright? Now let's drop the subject."
Leela, I do miss the Earth terribly.  I wonder if it's even still there.
Leela," Negative, Sailor Moon. We're goin' for a sleigh ride."
Fry," Bigfoot? Is that you? I'm not like the others, Bigfoot; I see through your monster coatings to the gentle loner inside. I bet you have a wounded racoon friend that you tenderly nurse back to health while you go... But in the end they shoot you. But you teach us about things. Oh. Just a flying saucer. Excuse me? You can't park here. The parking area's over there. Wow! Nice tube. Hey! Hey, what's the big idea? Stop abducting me. Why does your vanity plate say ""Probe 1""?"
Farnsworth," Bender, a robot sex change is a complex and dangerous procedure. Replacing your testosteroil with Fembot lubricants can cause wild mood swings. And the effects may be irreversible. Well, let's get started!"
Farnsworth," I'm sure no one's ever said this before, but I must get to Philadelphia as quickly as possible!"
Farnsworth, Your standard bending unit is made of an iron-osmium alloy. But Bender was different. Bender had a point-04% nickel impurity.
Fry," I've been sitting right here. I picked up my life exactly where I left off a thousand years ago. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's eight o'clock. Time to get biz-ay!"
Fry, This contest is as good as over. I once caught a fish this big.
Farnsworth," Get--! For the last time, Zoidberg, look with your eyes, not with your claws."
Fry, Swish!
Bender, Say what?
Fry, Wait! You're the only friend I have!
Fry, I feel like a mindless zombie.  I wish I knew how long we've been waiting.
Amy, Go away! We're not giving you our quarters no matter what.
Bender, I don't?
Fry, Woo-hoo!
Leela," Actually, feels kind of good. I guess I'm starting to associate it with the pleasure of beating people up."
Zoidberg, Police? Bah! Nosy meddlers! It so happens I have mail order degrees in Murderology and Murderonomy. Zoidberg is afoot!
Farnsworth," They're so stinking talented, they don't even need their fathers anymore."
Fry," Yes, Captain!"
Leela," Dr. Zoidberg, this is madness. You're being irrational."
Amy, Wow! Smart and cute!
Fry, Yeah! You show 'em!
Fry," Great! Now Amy's gonna tell Leela I'm a jerk. If only I could explain I'm on a secret mission against evil. Wait. Evil? Yeah, yeah, evil. What's going on in there? A scary noise? Hey, you're one of Leela's feministas. ""Save the environment! Wo-mandate Leo's retirement!"" That's terrible writing! Stop making your point so ineffectively!"
Bender," Yes, sir! Good one, sir!"
Fry, Or perhaps by odours!
Leela," Well, at least here you'll be treated with dignity. Now strip naked and get on the probulator."
Leela," That's enough insubordination, Mr. Fry!"
Bender," Hey, you spend your whole life building a guy's toe and you're gonna remember him. I think I'm gonna like it here!"
Leela," It wasn't a shark. It was an awful, incompetent doctor."
Leela," But, when they noticed you weren't him, they chucked you in a ditch."
Bender," Ah, great is OK, but amazing would be great."
Fry," My God! It's the future. My parents, my co-workers, my girlfriend; I'll never see any of them again. Yahoo!"
Farnsworth," Pretty long, eh?"
Fry, Stop! Take one more step and I'll breathe fire on you!
Fry, I'll take care of this! Back! Back!
Bender, Damn it!
Fry, Wow!
Leela," I'd like a pass to swim with Mushu, please."
Bender," I love this planet. I've got wealth, fame and access to sleaze that those things bring."
Fry, Talk about a mood killer!
Leela, But it's only a one-man craft...I say.
Fry," Nope, nothing. It's like when I passed out in college, except no one drew magic marker penises on my forehead."
Zoidberg," Hear my words. I believe I, the most humble member of Action Delivery Team, could do such a dance!"
Farnsworth," I had intended to unveil a beautiful stone memorial today. But, due to the recent tragedy, I humbly ask you to join me in a simple prayer."
Fry, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
Amy," Hi, Larry. I like your tattoos."
Zoidberg, That is so unfair!
Leela," Oh, thank you."
Leela," Fry, you traitor!"
Amy," Everything's going to be alright, Leela."
Bender," Yeah, get lost! Ooh! I'm a scary Femputer. Release the prisoners! And bring gold. Lots of gold."
Leela, We can't call them that.
Leela," Let's face it, you two have deep relationship problems that can't be solved by an aphrodisiac."
Farnsworth, Lay down here and we'll do some tests. If Fry is out there then Leela's brain could be acting as a five-pound Ouija board.
Bender, I sure am. But check the crotch. Nothing.
Fry, Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me here!
Fry, And it led there again when we got home.
Hermes," It was Zoidberg! He brutalised us with power tools, gypsy curses, and hypnosis!"
Bender, Yes! With this built-in stadium airhorn I can really annoy people. And all it cost me was my crotch-plate.
Fry, Help! I was attacked in my bathroom! By my bathroom! I'm being haunted by a ghost!
Fry, Now these monkeys I like! What's that? You wanna come out?
Bender, What?
Bender," Hey, I need that to smoke!"
Bender," Granted, it's not on the list of approved bendables, but I'm so great!"
Fry, That's what I was gonna say!
Leela," Dude, the Fountain of Aging must be on the sun itself."
Leela," A week? What do you think, Dr. Zoidberg?"
Zoidberg, Anyone have access to a lofty realm of gravy?
Fry," Hmm, must be a friend of theirs."
Fry," Nope. Not vaccinated either! Besides, it's not like one vote ever made a difference."
Farnsworth, Because. And says me. It's an extremely dangerous mission that killed my last crew. And you're not nearly as good as them.
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Those asinine morons who cancelled us were themselves fired for incompetence."
Farnsworth," Oh, fiddlepoop! Our weapons aren't strong enough to puncture a thin plastic tent that thick?!"
Fry, I do other human stuff! I age! See?
Bender," That's right, we want some money— Wait. What's this about Fry?"
Farnsworth," Of course he still exists  As a frozen corpse in outer space! Oh, I made myself sad."
Leela, That's not Earth.
Amy," Hey, Bender! Great new sweater."
Bender, Alright!
Leela, Did you really think you'd need all this junk in the afterlife?
Bender," Hello. We're here because we, uh, love our planet!"
Fry," This is Fry. If you're calling about the used towels for sale, they're still available for $45 each."
Amy," Oh, no!"
Leela," Fry, stay back!"
Farnsworth," Yes, tapping the Earth's ener-kerchoo. Go on."
Leela, Amen.
Leela, Wait!
Bender," Wait, what? Did someone say I'm great?"
Bender," Lynn? Huh, wow, you look great. Fat, but great. I thought you were in Oregon."
Leela, Uh-huh!
Bender," It's too risky. I'm a very meek individual. If her personality engulfs mine, the Bender you know and worship could disappear forever!"
Leela," Oh, I always knew I'd die at the bottom of a pit. But a pit full of tar?"
Hermes, That's a calculator. I ate it to gain its power.
Fry, You might.
Bender," I'm gonna be the greatest Ultimate Robot Fighter ever. Float like a floatbot, sting like an automatic stinging machine!"
Bender, Not without their shoes.
Fry, She always liked not being observed with a telescope.
Leela, Well I can't just do that anymore. Your best friend is out there somewhere destroying himself.
Bender," Strike! In your face, Leela! Ow!"
Bender, Hey buddies who wants popcorn?
Hermes, Here. Go up on the roof and install this fake satellite dish so we can impress the neighbours.
Leela, I've got an idea. Hold still. It's about to break. Yes! Yes!
Fry," Whoa! Letters like ""U"" and ""R"" can mean words like ""You"" and ""Are"". Here, Leela, ""U-R-2 Cute""."
Fry," My fellow fish monsters, far be it for me to question your stupid civilisation or its dumb customs, but is squeezing each other's brains out with a giant nutcracker really going to solve anything? Dr. Zoidberg is my friend, and though a woman has come between us, I say we'll always remain friends. And you know why? One reason. You bastard! I'll kill you! You bastard!"
Hermes, Now he's wearing a hat!
Farnsworth, I found a description of the creature in this medieval monster manual. Just as I feared. Attack type J.
Leela, That doesn't sound so dangerous.
Leela, Perhaps. What's your point?
Bender," I'm hallucinating this, right?"
Fry, I love this job.
Fry, Help! What's happening?
Farnsworth, You're lying!
Leela, You can count on me.
Leela," Bender, be careful!"
Bender," Oh, it's true! I've been hiding it for so long."
Leela," Well, why don't you think back to what brought you together in the first place?"
Fry," Yeah, I know Ooh! How 'bout this one?"
Bender, No. Fry? But ... I killed you in 2012. Unless ...
Bender, Is he any good?
Hermes, So... You grow hemp?
Hermes," Wait. I found a loophole in the mortgage. If we actually pay it, we can keep the building. We just need... Eleven million dollars."
Bender, My roommate's sleeping.
Leela, That story stunk. Hand me the binoculars. I think the owner is from Cygnus 5.
Farnsworth," Oh, my. That steamed carrot was a bit spicy for me."
Farnsworth," Nonsense! Zoidberg's a fine physician. For Aliens. Your mistake is being Humans! No. If I'm going to fire anyone, it'll be Scruffy."
Leela, Fry? I thought you were dead.
Bender, Alright! I'm rich!
Bender," Pardon me, I'm new to this game. Is this duffle bag big enough for all your money?"
Fry, Psst! Watching myself work is making me hungry. Help me find some food somewhere.
Farnsworth, Certainly not. Two dings means it's done. But not like that. Slightly more rapid.
Bender, Here ya go.
Zoidberg, He's not bluffing!
Bender," Oh, my God! I just felt it ferment!"
Bender," Ooh! Ooh! I wanna know what would happen if I were human. I mean, being a robot's great, but we don't have emotions and sometimes that makes me very sad."
Bender," You shan't be disappointed. Pleasant dreams. [Calculon turns the lights off and his eyes close, but Bender's do not. Instead they extend out towards Calculon's eyes. Calculon opens his eyes and looks at Bender's as they quickly move even closer to his own."
Farnsworth, And my mother's maiden name and her bank account numbers and ... There! I'm rich. Rich. Rich!
Bender, Aw! Its anus looks like an asterisk.
Amy, You're having an affair with the head of the robot mafia's wife?
Zoidberg, No! My home! It burned down! How did this happen?
Bender," I'm done siphoning out the grease trap. I think I need a mint. So, uh, what job do I move up to? Pastry chef? Saucier? Soup guy?"
Fry, For me it is! I'm getting you outta here!
Fry, That's awful. It's like brainwashing.
Amy, Look on the bright side  My parents left after you passed out so they didn't even see you barf.
Leela," The guard operating the x-ray machine came down with a sudden case of broken neck, so I was able to bring you that delicious cake you wanted."
Zoidberg, To hell with your spoiled baby! I need those shoes!
Fry," Here lies Philip J. Fry, named for his uncle to carry on his spirit."
Farnsworth," Quickly, into the ship's basement! Now, then, as you all know, the county fair is approaching once again, so I'm preparing my entry of pickled winds and weathers. I've got sunny, snow flurry, hail with onions, even my grandmother's cranberry-raisin typhoon, but no tornado. I'll be damned if I let Mrs. Girdleson take the blue ribbon again. That's why I need you folks to get out there and harvest a nice ripe one. This cattle prod should help."
Farnsworth," Well, they're still young. Mere atomic super boys, really. We'll need to speed up their growth with time particles called Chronitons."
Leela, I choose to save the environment by sabotaging Leo Wong's golf course. Who's with me?
Bender, Then how about this little number? Pure-bred human. No vampire in there.
Fry, I can't stop eating this delicious ooze. But I'm not gonna let you die.
Bender, I'll have to check my program ... yep.
Farnsworth," My goodness, I'm rich! And to think I didn't even know I had a ticket. I just need to wire some collateral to collect the winnings."
Bender, I'll try to put it in terms you can comprehend. I passed the existential singularity.
Bender," Sure ... right. Robot! Oh, Fry! My skin's all dry and clanky."
Bender," Put it there, pal! I meant your wallet."
Farnsworth," We're certainly not building something sinister, if that's what your implying. Now, come on, Bender. Something sinister won't build itself."
Fry," Uh, we usually call it the lightning round."
Fry," 50,000? Drat, all I have is my life savings and a token for free admission to this poker tournament."
Leela, Nibbler?
Bender, Holy crap! It's a giant space fish!
Farnsworth," No! That would alter history. Above all else, it is our sacred duty to preserve the past exactly as it was."
Bender," It can and, for all you know, it is. I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead."
Leela," Oh, yeah, this salad's fantastic. So fresh."
Fry," C'mon, let's sneak in for a closer look."
Leela," Oh, that's so sweet, Fry. But for once in my life, I just wanna look normal."
Fry," Or do we? No, I guess not."
Leela, Don't thank me! I should be punished! I've corrupted you and taught the orphans a terrible lesson.
Bender," Well, actually, I-- Sir, yes, sir! Sir!"
Bender," Oh, man, that crap's heavy."
Leela," No, Fry, by ""close quarters"" I mean this office--"
Leela, Ow! My eye! I'm blind!
Fry, Hi!
Farnsworth, Wha?
Fry, Robot daughters?
Bender, Nibbler?
Hermes, Surprise!
Fry, And you made me feel like a jerk for trusting you. Just like when my friend Richie swore he wasn't taking drugs and then he sold me my mom's VCR and then later I found out he was taking drugs. You make me ashamed to be your friend.
Farnsworth," Quiet! Quiet, I say!"
Fry, This is stupid. I'm taking this thing out to the real moon.
Bender, Way to suck it!
Bender, Prepare for a surprise attack.
Bender, I like turtles.
Leela, Wow. This is beautiful.
Fry, Dang! So what does this Dark One look like?
Fry, Look!
Fry," Sorry, I'm not here to buy."
Leela, Is he blackmailing you somehow?
Farnsworth, Fry! What in Sega Genesis happened to you?
Fry, Did someone call me?
Fry, That wasn't cowardice.
Fry, Can't imagine why I would.
Bender," Iron Cook, eh? I can't lose. I'm 30% iron! You're going down! Uh, also I had a reservation for one, under ""Dr. Bender""."
Farnsworth," I'm glad you agree, Dr. Banjo."
Zoidberg," What, now?"
Bender," lt wasn't them. lt was me, Bender. The master criminal!"
Bender, A saucy puppet show.
Zoidberg, Someone in trouble is!
Leela," Nobody tell Fry I'm deaf. If he found out I couldn't hear his opera, it'd break his heart."
Farnsworth," Fry, we have no idea what you do around here, but we desperately need you back."
Fry," Uh, I'm looking for human horn."
Bender," Man, I'm gonna stalk his brains out. Ooh! Big news on the Calculon fan site! There's a flash mob headed for his plastic surgeon's office!"
Hermes, Ow! You hurt my collator!
Leela," Look, I'm not saying Bender's not great but have you ever considered that maybe he's, y'know, not that great?"
Leela, Over there! It's the original Planet Express ship!
Zoidberg, Switch bodies? I don't see why not. I also don't see why.
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! I've invented a way to turn Bender into a human using a process I call ""reverse fossilisation""."
Leela," Hey, kid. Catch!"
Leela, Just do it.
Fry, Then it's a deal. We get one night. I keep my horn as long as you two end up doing the horizontal monster mash.
Amy, Too bad we won't make it back in time for the memorial service.
Farnsworth," Ah, but this time machine only goes forward in time. That way you can't accidentally change history. Or do something disgusting like sleep with your own grandmother."
Fry, From everybody?
Bender," Well, just in case you guys hit it off, you'll wanna take this with you."
Farnsworth, Nothing is impossible. Not if you can imagine it. That's what being is a scientist is all about.
Leela," You know. Pirates, but in space."
Fry, Oh! Oh!
Leela," Shut up, Terry."
Bender," Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided fishing rod."
Zoidberg, I'm a Globetrotter!
Leela, We're cutting through the Bermuda Tetrahedron.
Farnsworth, We're monsters!
Fry," No, no... Well, yes, actually."
Fry, I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy!
Leela, Eurgh!
Fry," Um, Leela?"
Bender," You mean, there's really no such thing? Then who's there to mete out justice when an outdated robot is melted into belt buckles? Who's there to defend our honour when a rude human brings a blush to a robo-virgin's cheek?"
Fry," 50,000!"
Hermes, Labor Day? That phoney-baloney holiday crammed down our throats by fat-cat union gangsters?
Bender, Get her purse!
Bender," My word, what have we-- Uh, nothing to see here, old girl."
Bender, This.
Fry," Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give you a hand?"
Bender," Aw, shoot!"
Leela," Where?  Also, what?"
Fry, It's too low.
Bender, You can trust anything.
Farnsworth," Oh, hell!"
Bender, Well that's how it feels to me.
Fry, Think about it  Seymour lived a full life after I was gone. He probably even added new songs to his repertoire.
Farnsworth, Not you.
Fry, We don't wanna know!
Leela, Death sphere in range.  Engaging holographic targeting.  Activating the Force.
Bender," So the moral of the story is  If you want it to stay sunk, tie a weight to it!"
Bender," An alibi, huh?"
Amy, It's like he doesn't understand simple humanoid emotion.
Leela, Sh! Those words are forbidden!
Fry, I hope your calculations are correct.
Leela," And I think I know a way to do it. We have to reacquaint him with a little thing called ""sleaze""."
Bender, Nope!
Farnsworth, Well then it's settled. So long everyone!
Zoidberg," Not bad for a city boy, huh? By the way, I took the liberty of fertilising your caviar."
Bender," Oh, alright, I'll just take these $300 burglars tools then."
Bender," An open casting call for child robots? Tinny Tim, are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'?"
Fry, Hooray for Leela!
Fry, What about me?
Leela," Aw, leave Fry alone. His intelligence is just a little differenty."
Fry, Oh no! I'm late.
Leela, Looks rickety. We'd better test it.
Fry, Granted. We can't take off without our captain.
Leela, Please! Everyone knows 20th century colleges were basically expensive daycare centres.
Fry," Goodbye, Bender."
Bender, You lazy runts! Don't you get paid for making the toys?
Bender, I can't keep running people over. I'm not famous enough to get away with it. Can't you help me?
Amy, What's going on?
Farnsworth, No. I'm afraid the Smellescope isn't powerful enough. Bender's odour is so mild it's being overpowered by local sources.
Fry," But, but--"
Fry, Who's that jerk?
Leela, What? Why would you do that?
Bender, Mission accomplished.
Fry, What's going on? How did we save you?
Leela, What is it?
Bender," Nope. I pulled the old switcheroo, so they won't even know the difference. Wait a minute, I think the copy I made cost more than this."
Fry, Bender! I thought the Robot Mafia killed you.
Bender, The very idea!
Farnsworth, We don't know where the hell 'e is.
Farnsworth," Well, that's it. Let's reactivate him. Wake up!"
Leela, Aw. They were?!
Fry," Hmm. According to this map, the only way out is through ... that pipe. Don't worry. It gets wider after about a mile."
Amy, What is it?
Fry, Whose behind does that come from?
Leela, You and Morgan were having an affair?
Farnsworth," Uh, as I've said before, I used reverse fossilisation, which is the reverse of regular, um..."
Fry, But... But...
Bender, We're going back to civilisation to wage war on technology!
Farnsworth, Oh dear Lord!
Fry, Hey! You opened a franchise!
Leela, Look! One eye! Count them  One! Not human!
Fry, 10.77. Same as my PIN number.
Fry," I'm sorry, I-I thought you were made of wax."
Leela," Gas was an environmental disaster, anyway. Now we use alternative fuels."
Amy, No. Let's buy Internet stock!
Fry, You're right. I'll give it a shot!
Fry, C'mon! Let's go tell Leela so we can grow up together!
Bender," Unlikely. In my mind, we're friends. This diorama proves it, see?"
Farnsworth, Wait a moment. I think I was just shanked with a screwdriver! Yes!
Bender," Oh, yeah? Well I wasn't built to steal Leela's purse either. But that didn't stop me."
Fry, Where are we?
Hermes," That's it, Barbados Slim. You've gone one toke over the line!"
Leela," Uh, look, before you get any crazy ideas, that was for Zapp."
Bender, Or a cheap...
Farnsworth," Interesting. It's as if we behave normally during the time skips, but then we have no memory of it."
Amy, Pineapple?
Amy, It's so anomalous.
Leela," Good afternoon, sir. Name?"
Bender," Ooh, sparks! Buy her a rose, I guarantee she'll put out!"
Farnsworth," Yes, let's all talk about Leela's personal life later. But right now we have business to attend to."
Fry," Hurry, Bender. Get the bra!"
Leela, That's the dumbest question I ever heard!
Fry, You think I'm an oddity? Wait'll you see--
Farnsworth," Dr. Franklin, with all due respect to the brilliant inventor of the... stove, I must speak with you. I'm looking for the scoundrel who made this!"
Fry, I'd hate to be those guys.
Hermes," Take a rage dump, man. He's no worse than Bender."
Leela," This time it's your reckless disregard for the environment. In fact, I'm gonna go join those protestors."
Bender," See? Nothing. Told you, losers."
Fry," Check it out, y'all. Everyone we invited is here."
Fry, What does that mean?
Fry, Nothing in here but a couple of elephant skin rugs.
Fry, I've only got two fantasies left  Be invisible in a chocolate factory and be romantically linked with a celebrity.
Zoidberg," My slinky! My cuddly, little pet slinky!"
Fry," Yeah, I'd like to place a collect call."
Leela," You saved millions of lives, Fry. You should feel proud. No matter what your dad said to you."
Farnsworth, My thong!
Bender," And I'm Bender, baby. My human slaves and I come from a planet where organic life and robotic life evolved side by side."
Bender," Struggling alone again incredible odds, I, Bender, managed to kill him. I blew him to mush like a midget in a microwave."
Bender, Viva Hermenthotip!
Fry, Yay!
Bender," So what's your problem? It's not like you slept with him. Oh, my God!"
Leela," This is hopeless. If we're gonna get blown to bits, we might as well do it in the comfort of our own home."
Fry, No!
Leela," Your Honour, it's all true  My female incompetence, Zapp's cat-like reflexes, the stuff that made no sense, all of it."
Fry, Yep. My friend's cousin's caseworker saw one once. It's a widely-believed fact.
Leela, Much rather! What are you doing?
Leela," Please don't stop playing, Fry. I wanna hear how it ends."
Farnsworth," Oh, they had me hooked up to a bizarre virtual world that seemed absolutely real."
Leela, In what field?
Fry," Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere with your life too much."
Leela," We could always switch back, right?"
Fry, I'd like a sewer burger but without the rat faeces.
Farnsworth," I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke once and for all."
Bender," Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry."
Bender," Pfft! In your dreams, nutloaf."
Farnsworth, Because I don't want you touching that thing.
Leela, We'll get them there as quickly as we can.
Leela, ...and Vergon 6 is about to implode. We need your help.
Zoidberg," Ah, if only they appreciated freedom this much on my home planet. Wait a second! They do! Because this is my home planet."
Bender, Pfff! At least Reverend Pickens had the dignity to jump out the whorehouse window with his pants around his ankles.
Bender," How's Calculon going to take this, Fry, especially after that humiliating tennis tournament? Fry?"
Bender," I am so great! Bender is great! Bender, Bender, Bender-- Man, where'd the time go? Hey, you guys wanna— Oh. Right. They turned into petroleum oil! I thought they were selfish, yet in the end it turned out it was I who thought they were selfish!"
Bender,"  I'll miss her, too, buddy. Dibs on her iPod."
Zoidberg," Ah, my old scuttling grounds! Let's pull over."
Farnsworth," Now, Hermes, you and your lovely wife, LaBarbara, have the suite through there. And Dr. Zoidberg, your marble tank is on the other side."
Leela," Uh ... what if we go for a walk, possibly, because it's such a lovely day, perhaps."
Fry, What just happened?
Farnsworth," Due to the atoms tremendous value, Planet Express would go bankrupt if it was stolen. Therefore we'll need to hire on additional security for the mission."
Fry, Leela! You're alive!
Farnsworth, Wha? W-W-What do you want from me?
Fry, All what?
Bender, Me too.
Fry," These eyePhones are phones, too?"
Leela, Especially for Bender.
Fry, It is? Yahoo! We're poor no matter what I do! The deal is off!
Zoidberg, You're making a mistake! I was only trying to kill the Professor!
Bender," ""Blackmail"" is such an ugly word. I prefer ""extortion"". The ""X"" makes it sound cool. Please, honey, I'm made of metal. Like you're really gonna hurt me with a-- Hey! What are you doing with that microwave?"
Leela, It's like staring into the face of God!
Bender, Shut up. Come over here.
Bender," Alright, alright. Let me just do one thing to cheer myself up. Fry cracked corn, And I don't care, Leela cracked corn, I still don't care, Bender cracked corn, And he is great! Take that, you stupid corn!"
Amy," Uh, Mom, I don't-- Hi!"
Farnsworth, Who else has a question for the What-If machine? Scruffy? Katrina? Xanthor?
Leela," I can earn my own rocks! Also, I don't want any rocks!"
Farnsworth, Oh! I'm blind!
Hermes," Hermes Conrad, bureaucrat grade 36."
Bender, You should say someth'n' else.
Fry, That telescope is as much mine as anybody's. I'm using it whether you give me permission or not.
Fry, Whoa.
Leela, Just get in the car.
Zoidberg," None of your beeswax, slave! You'll find out soon enough. Just focus on globing that mud. Glob!"
Fry," Sure. Y'know, I think I finally figured out what's behind all these mysterious deaths."
Bender," Hey, he's not dead. What's up with that?"
Hermes, Sweet freak of Mozambique! That thing's colossal! It's gonna kill us all!
Leela," Exactly, you're in L.A."
Fry, I can eat a hotdog underwater.
Amy, Should we do something?
Fry, A tomato.
Amy," Mmm... ""It's NUTSO Good!"""
Fry, Are you still mad at me for wrecking your once-in-a-lifetime chance to learn the meaning of your existence?
Farnsworth, I don't understand. Are you winking or blinking?
Leela, You're right! I'll start by not caring what you think! I'm getting the surgery.
Bender, Yeah. Would you kindly shut your noise hole?
Hermes," Goodbye, Mr. Dumbsworth!"
Fry, What are we supposed to do? Just sit here and wait for Mr. Peppy to be killed?
Leela, Do you mind?
Fry, Pizza dinner on me! Just keep the tab under $50 million.
Bender," Oh, no! They're forming Gigatron!"
Fry," I know, we seem like a perfect match, but I just don't feel that way about her."
Leela, Stay here.
Farnsworth, I'm ready to seduce. I'm wearing my kissing dentures and my evening truss.
Leela, Convenient.
Leela," Well, so long. Keep in touch."
Fry, You're cute!
Fry, Near the Keeler Crater on Mars. Do you know it?
Bender," Y'know, I think I he might be dead. I took a life!"
Farnsworth," Well I don't know about all-knowing. And I admit it's possible, however unlikely, that some wise and all-knowing alien monster set evolution in motion here on Earth."
Leela, What?
Fry, And the rest!
Fry," Did you get that, Chief?"
Fry, What happens if we lose?
Leela," Uh, alright. Here I go. There's no place like-- I wanna be a witch! Oh, no! Help! What's happening?"
Amy, Buh-bye.
Leela, We made it! And some of the animals survived.
Bender, Convert them?
Zoidberg, For now. But another threat from the stars is sure to arise next week at the same time!
Zoidberg," So what is it, already?"
Farnsworth, Your insides will boil out of your eye sockets like a science fair volcano.
Zoidberg, Can I? That's my specialty.
Zoidberg, A complete sangwich? You got fleeced! I would have settled for a hard roll with ketchup inside!
Farnsworth," Why, certainly. Step over here."
Farnsworth," As new employees, I'd like your opinion on our commercial. I paid to have it air during the Super Bowl."
Bender," Shaken, not stirred. Aw, yeah!"
Fry, Uh-oh. Is this gonna be another crazy experiment that crosses a line Man was not meant to cross?
Leela," No, listen. It's very important that you never, ever tell anyone under any circumstance."
Bender," Psst, Fry. Take a dive."
Fry," Bender, you can move! You're cured!"
Farnsworth," Ah say, what's that in your crown?"
Leela," Fry, you're alive!"
Bender, Hey! That place had a gorgeous view of Blood Lake.
Bender, The truth is often stupid.
Fry, The robot? That's similar to mine!
Farnsworth, Time-out! Time-out!
Fry, Just tell her.
Leela, Shut up!
Leela, So we have to bring back two of each kind. Just like Noah's Ark.
Leela, Bender? What happened to you?
Fry," I'm bored. You're boring, Zoidberg. I'm gonna go watch TV."
Bender," Ay! Oh! Piscopo! This guy! Bada-boing! Hey, sexy. I'm Bender. What brings you to this tacky soirée?"
Bender, But ... those girls don't wear cases. You can see their bare circuits.
Leela," Don't listen to him, Lrrr. Bender may seem happy. But in the long-tern, you need to reinvest in your relationship with Ndnd."
Hermes," Aww, he's holding a spoon."
Leela, A tapeworm!
Leela," No, but I used to play the drums. They're sorta similar. What happens if we lose?"
Farnsworth, Good idea!
Bender, 500 bucks.
Leela, Dolphin? But dolphins are intelligent.
Farnsworth, Perhaps they've constructed a teddy bear hospital!
Bender, Ow.
Leela," Uh, listen, Zapp."
Fry, But-- But I'm the delivery boy.
Hermes, What did she say?
Fry," Uh, wait, this is the other Fry's locker. I'm ""Phry"" with a P-H."
Leela, Your permanent career assignment.
Fry," Uh, listen, is there maybe some way we could do this with you going and me not going?"
Amy, Here's my new theory. That is one adorable cat.
Leela," Oh, God! Fruit is spelled F-R-O-O-T. And it's got quotation marks around it."
Farnsworth, That is stupid!
Fry, I like those odds!
Bender, I'm the first one to work. A new low.
Leela, It's true. Thanks to this funky-fresh cream.
Fry," I can't tell you, Leela. You just have to trust me."
Leela," Uh, sure, OK. What do you take with that?"
Farnsworth," Now, I've simulated that collision using Shrapnovision(?)."
Leela," Is that what this is all about? Please, just cut it out now."
Amy," Yeah! Hey, later, you wanna drive out to Europa? We could have a picnic and spit watermelon seeds at Jupiter."
Fry, No question!
Farnsworth, Or perversions of a sexual nature.
Bender, Death to all of you!
Zoidberg," Yum, yum, yum! Uh-oh! Look at me, I'm Dr. Zoidberg, homeowner!"
Amy, Buh!
Fry," No, it's nothing like that. It's just that I am worried about him. He's being playing an awful lot of Dungeons & Dragons."
Bender," Great choice! Bring it on, baby!"
Farnsworth, I'm too young to die!
Bender," I'll save us! Oh, that feels good!"
Hermes, We can't make it tonight. We'll set up camp here by this shoe.
Farnsworth, Yes. The science mobile!
Bender, No thanks.
Leela," Yep. It's December 31st, 2999."
Zoidberg, Can't I have a scented bath in peace?
Hermes, Someone come and dropped this package through the slot last night. Now which one of you is the captain?
Fry," Amy, what I'm trying to say is, I think maybe you and I should stop--"
Fry, What if I folded the Professor's sweaters for you?
Farnsworth, Of course not. That's why scientists increased the speed of light in 2208.
Hermes, We did harbor a mutant! Uh-oh.
Bender," Oh, yeah! That calms the shakes. Hey! Aw, quit it! Come on!"
Fry," Oh, yeah? Read it and weep. I'm a certified college dropout."
Leela," Don't worry.  By tomorrow, no one will remember."
Leela," OK, we'll tell them the Professor escaped and we're bringing him back. Fry, you'll have to dress up like a 160-year-old man."
Farnsworth," It sounds dangerous. Someone could get killed. Fry, Leela, Bender, I want you to go with him."
Fry," Yup. It's exhausting, but I need the extra money to buy coffee so I can stay awake for my night job."
Farnsworth," To communicate with the bees, we'll need to use these trans-bumbalators. Bender, say something in bee talk."
Leela," Now, hang on.  Before you do construction, don't you have to make sure you're not harming any native species?"
Zoidberg, I say do what it tells us.
Leela," Alright, Alcazar, I just have one last question for you."
Farnsworth," The vaccine requires the original, unmutated, 20th-century cold virus. So I need to grind you into a paste."
Fry," 'Preciate it, Guenter!"
Hermes, Wow!
Fry," I hate my life, I hate my life, I hate my life."
Leela," Actually, most doctors are rich."
Fry," Yo, that's messed up."
Leela, I think I might be a couple years younger.
Leela, I don't need help. For your information I did this all by myself.
Fry, I'm in!
Hermes, Look what he can do.
Leela, Who would've thought hell would really exist? And that it would be in New Jersey!
Fry," It's OK, Bender. I like cooking too."
Fry," He's alive! Bender, what was it like lying in that hole for a thousand years?"
Farnsworth, Wernstrom!
Fry," Hi, Animatronio."
Hermes," If you ever needed a small package brought into the country without a lot of X-raying and such, Bender always had a free body cavity."
Bender, I'll kill you!
Leela," Lrrr, I'm getting angry. Don't you go through with this."
Fry, Uh-oh!
Fry, You don't look very old.
Bender, Aw! Are you still hung up on Whatshername? Move on already!
Bender, We did it!
Farnsworth," So he just showed up unannounced, raided the liquor cabinet, sprayed urine on the ceiling and passed out?"
Bender," Back to work, Hermes!"
Bender, I'll start loading up the pillows.
Leela," Bender, you drank and smoked when you were a robot."
Bender," I must say, this opens my eyes. Another case closed, my dear Watson."
Fry, Bathroom!
Fry," Please, let me make it up to you. I'll treat you to a fancy birthday dinner tonight at Cavern on the Green."
Leela, That's it. I'll take you on right now.
Fry, Bender's stupid religion is driving me nuts.
Fry, Mmm!
Leela," Maybe I waited too long to say this, but I love you, too- wormhole!"
Fry, This isn't Yemeni! It's Sulawesi! And the cup's shaking! I don't want my coffee shaking!
Leela, Bender! How could you be so lazy and irresponsible?
Fry," Okay, dork. Listen, I'm gonna hit the urinal, maybe talk about myself a little bit, then—"
Hermes," Once I log in, I can access Inspector 5's profile."
Amy, Rudolph's nose!
Leela, It will be in a couple hours.
Leela, It's all the best stuff I ever flushed down the toilet! Those are some of my diary pages. And my screenplay!
Leela," But then Nicolas Cage discovered that the real treasure was his family. Yes, I'll hold."
Leela," Captain Brannigan, we really need to talk to you about our mission."
Amy, They actually built the planetary ratchet from my thesis! Uh-oh.
Leela, Hi-yah!
Leela, But the phoney stuff is what's fun. It's boring out there.
Bender," Hey, what if Fry wasn't actually dead when we buried him? Y'know like Julia Roberts?"
Bender," What, and have the Mafia come after me too?! No way! This secret goes to my grave!"
Bender, Go faster? I told them but they're so damn lazy.
Fry," Look, Leela, I don't understand this world but you obviously do, so I give up. If you really think I should be a delivery boy, I'll do it. Your chip. What are you doing?"
Farnsworth," Go, team! Beat those no good Cygnoids! Show them they stink at a game they've never played before!"
Amy, What?
Farnsworth," Impossible! The supernova time hole is closing! If we don't leave now, we'll never get back to the 31st century."
Farnsworth, Wern--strom!
Bender, They're not very heavy but you don't hear me not complaining.
Amy, And the walls.
Hermes, You did ruin her life.
Fry, I didn't come to play. I came to win. Now let's play.
Farnsworth," Poor, ignorant Leela. The bone vampire is now extinct on its home planet."
Fry, Are they dead?
Farnsworth," Zoidberg, are you coming?"
Zoidberg," Don't be so hard on yourself, Fry. You lost the woman of your dreams but you still have Zoidberg. You all still have Zoidberg."
Bender, I'm the greatest. Woo-hoo!
Bender," Aw, man. Do I have to walk?"
Bender," It's so unfair. A debonair robot with a zesty in-your-face outlook doomed to obscurity like the rest of you, especially Leela. If I died tomorrow, no one would even notice."
Fry, I'll never remember that.
Amy," Well... My boyfriend and I were gonna have sex on a burning flag, but... I could have a bite."
Bender," It's the decaying ruins of Old New York. Welcome home, pal!"
Fry," That's great, Leela."
Bender," Oh, sweet legal tender! Kid, tell the Donbot I'm quitting organised crime. From now on I'll stick to regular kind."
Bender," I intend to. Through the lost art of the toast. To Angle-ine, she's got it all. Looks, charm and the love of a fabulous bending robot."
Fry," Uh, look; we've got mail for Santa. Are you his elves?"
Zoidberg, Hmm?
Bender," Gonna sing a little tale about a battle called Waterloo. Bonjour, y'all!"
Fry," OK, Leela, you'll be starring as Jenny--"
Bender," Hey, this guy's alright!"
Fry," So? You've got a leech on your neck. Oh, and speaking of sucking on your neck, want to go to a movie later?"
Bender," Uh, as for me, I'm late for my LSAT's."
Leela, How do you know it didn't disintegrate?
Fry, We've got nothing better to do.
Farnsworth," Why, of course! It's just a name! Like the Death Zone or the Zone of No Return. All the zones have names like that in the Galaxy of Terror!"
Fry," That's where I know her from. She's Jenny McNeal. She was a character on a TV show back in the 20th century, Single Female Lawyer."
Farnsworth," You'll be the captain, you'll be the delivery boy, and you'll be the alcoholic, foul-mouthed-- Oh, God, you're alive. I mean, thank God you're alive! Sorry, check back in three days, a week at the most."
Fry, But if I'd been there I--
Amy, Then take some Echinacea or a St. John's wort.
Fry, Controversial?
Farnsworth, Keep your chin up!
Zoidberg," Relax, Bender. I'll dry up that leak with this heating box."
Fry," I knew somethin' was wrong, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Then it hit me. You showed Bender sharing the deadly booze with our friends. Bender would never share!"
Farnsworth, Crazy gibberish!
Leela, Men who call too much are the worst ... I bet.
Farnsworth, Why did you boys do all this?
Fry," Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize I was already here. Wait, what's with all the Leelas?"
Farnsworth, He knows when you're on the can.
Leela, You are one devious bastard.
Leela," Zapp, we're out of fuel..."
Leela, I understand. I'm the only one-eyed alien on this whole planet. My parents abandoned me here as a baby and I don't even know what galaxy they were from. I know how it feels to be alone.
Leela, They're beautiful.
Leela, That's what makes it so sad. I thought I was doing something heroic.
Fry," Hey, thanks for coming."
Bender," Nah, I've always wanted a pet."
Bender," Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care, Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care,"
Amy," That's her name, Philip."
Bender," How about some aftershave, dumpy?"
Farnsworth," Bad news, nobody. The super collider super-exploded. I need you to take it back and exchange it for a wobbly CD rack and some of those rancid meatballs."
Farnsworth," Pazuzu, you ungrateful gargoyle! I put you through college, and this is how you repay me?"
Fry," Damnit, we'll have to fix the engine ourself."
Hermes, Do you spin a dreidel made from clay?
Leela, Oh. Then I have a new vow. I solemnly swear that I will become not the worst blernsball player of all time.
Farnsworth," The Fountain of Aging? Hmm. It is just a legend. Still, they called the Tooth Fairy a legend and now he's head of the FBI."
Bender," Hey, that guy said to tell you that--"
Fry," Well, I guess we'd better clean up these millions of hearts."
Fry, Whoa! Fifteen miles over the speed of light.
Hermes," But, Doctor, will I be able to limbo afterwards?"
Leela, Thank you. It's all so beautiful. I forgot how many hundreds of degrees below zero it must be. I just wish I could convince the others you're alive.
Leela, Like the tuba.
Bender, Pervert.
Bender," and  ...giant Thermos,"
Farnsworth," A billion robot lives are about to be extinguished. Oh, the Jedis are going to feel this one!"
Farnsworth," Only puny, mammal-like robots cowering in caves could survive such a catastrophe."
Fry, Uh-oh.
Fry, I'd like to see them find it!
Leela, You mean that yellow brick road?
Fry," My roommate exploded. Oh, you gotta help me, Bender. How can I prove I'm human?"
Farnsworth," Top secret news, everyone! I've developed a tiny one-man stealth fighter that's virtually undetectable."
Fry," I would, but I ate a bunch of potato salad, so..."
Fry," It's moving too fast! Oh, I could never get the last one. My brother always got it for me."
Fry," Hey, business is great."
Farnsworth," We're trapped, my sweet hippopotamus!"
Farnsworth," I'll be in the swamp, blowing the smirk off a toxic Yeti."
Farnsworth," A warning that will be administered by this 50,000-volt shock collar."
Leela," Oh, Bender! When did you come in? Hold still!"
Zoidberg, Perfect! This oughta make me stand out. Craw!
Amy," Wow, it's ricketier than it looks. You'd better try to jump it, Bender."
Bender, Damn right!
Farnsworth," Come on, stem cells. Work your astounding scientific nonsense!"
Farnsworth," Please, old friend, don't jump. Use another method that won't damage your liver. Other people need it, you know."
Fry, Anything.
Amy," Look at us, living like trash eating bums in an alley now."
Amy, Is she coming?
Fry, What do you monsters want?
Zoidberg," Yes biggie. I learned to feel things I'd never felt before  Love, jealousy, passion for disembowelling. I owe it all to you. There! I pronounce the operation a success."
Bender, My booze!
Leela, Hmmm. All ancient satellites were swept up as space junk in 2113. I actually knew that offhand. I'm Facebooking right now.
Bender, Calculon's gonna kill us for sure. It's all everybody else's fault.
Farnsworth, C-C-Consort?
Fry, Call it a hunch but I've got a bad feeling about this.
Fry," I don't think so. Sir, I believe you owe this lady an apology."
Bender," With my mighty robot powers, I can get sick of things much quicker than you humans."
Leela, OK.
Bender, Anyone seen Ulysses Grant? He owes me a cheroot.
Fry, Happy new year.
Leela," Look out, Agnew!"
Zoidberg," Edna? Edna, it's me, Zoidberg. Remember, from high school? You used to laugh at me because my face was covered with barnacles!"
Leela," We need dark matter and we need it fast. Fry, check Nibbler's litter box. Maybe he dropped a steamer."
Fry, You do?
Amy, Let's go!
Bender, Wake up and feel the coffee.
Bender, Who should be unfreeze next?
Bender," Who could do a thing like that? And by ""that"", I mean this."
Fry, Can I do the countdown?
Fry, You know each other?
Fry, I'll lend you this.
Bender, Can I get anybody a beer?
Farnsworth, I'm as spry as a 140-year-old. See? I only broke one ankle.
Leela," Uh, couldn't be me. I never wear boots. See?"
Hermes," It wasn't me, Mr. F. It was Amy! Stop it, Amy!"
Bender," It's so cold, my processor is running at peak efficiency."
Farnsworth," The atom sits atop this dimestore tiara which will be awarded to the winner of this year's Miss Universe pageant on the planet Tova 9. Your job is to deliver it, safe and sound."
Leela, No. That's moronic.
Bender, Something's happening on television.
Leela, Pay dirt! Hi-yah!
Leela," Gentlemen, I've completed my report on the crash."
Bender," Hey, yeah, I could write a song! With real words, not phoney ones like ""odelay""."
Fry, You gotta spend money to make money.
Bender, Who does it look like? My identical cousin Buster?
Fry, Is there really so much of a distinction? I mean...
Bender," Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if I was wearing a lime green tank top."
Zoidberg," Aha! The guy in this body has a friend! Bender, old pal! It's me, the Fry!"
Bender," Yeah. You know, it's times like this I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight, you princes of Maine, you kings of New New England."
Leela, Whoever did this was strong. This is 340 pounds of Tonka-tough steel.
Fry, Alright!
Farnsworth," If, for example, you were to kill your grandfather, you would cease to exist."
Bender," Where do you think you're going, no-cat?"
Bender," Fry, you smelly idiot, I think he's willing to make some kind of deal with the devil with you."
Leela, Let’s hear the rest.
Bender," No chance, hot pants!  I'd rather die and kill all of you than party for one more millisecond!"
Fry," I'm not Bender, I'm Fry."
Bender, Learning is fun.
Farnsworth," Right, so long."
Farnsworth," This is no time for one of your jokes, Fry."
Bender, Can do!
Amy, But that's you.
Fry, He really is gone.
Fry, Hooray!
Leela, I've never felt so unremarkable! Today I actually blended in with a crowd!
Bender," Bet you weren't expecting that one, Calculon!"
Farnsworth, Hit what?
Amy," What's that splork on them? It's not germs, is it?"
Fry, Alright!
Amy," Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, I've been thinking, do you think we could go out?"
Hermes," Yeah, when the lights go out, it's nobody's business what happens between two consenting adults."
Leela, That is so unbelievably manipulative.
Leela, Well that's tough! Lots of people don't like their jobs but we do them anyway. You gotta do what you gotta do. Now hold out your hand. I'm gonna implant your career chip. It'll permanently label you as a delivery boy.
Fry, Can't we just cuddle? Nooo!
Leela," Yeah, yeah, relax. Trees down."
Leela," We are not ignorant villagers, we're sophisticated New New Yorkers. Whup his butt!"
Farnsworth," Ye Gods, Bubblegum! We failed. The time skips haven't stopped at all."
Leela, Bender? Did you have something to do with this?
Fry, I don't know. But it might have something to do with this.
Leela," Thanks, but I can look out for myself. Frankly, I can smell danger a mile away."
Leela, That's adorable!
Amy, Looks like it's speeding up.
Fry," It's that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong's footprint! Hey! My foot's bigger! Leela, isn't this the greatest thing you've ever seen?"
Bender," I know, right?"
Bender," No poison for us, thanks. I'll stick with good old mineral oil. Ah! Functional!"
Bender," Hurry up, you number-crunching crumb-nuncher! Everybody but me is dying of old age!"
Fry, See?
Leela, Bummer.
Fry," Uh, ""video game"" you say? Well, golly gee, you mighty spacemen of the future will have to show me how it works."
Bender," But not your only inspiration. Am I right, Leels?"
Fry," Hey, he was smart! He could fetch."
Leela, What do you mean? Watch this!
Fry, Which is good because we don't intend to pay.
Bender, Eh.
Hermes," Myself. I asked myself a Valentine's Day off, but I was in no mood for any of my shenanigans."
Leela, How can you just sit there kissing the aliens' butt flaps? Don't you realize you are totally under their control?
Amy, Do you think Calculon's evil twin will ever walk again?
Farnsworth," Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes. We have bigger problems. This time disruption is extremely serious."
Bender," I'm just messin' with ya. I love that you're gettin' rich off of them. 'Cause, now, I can get rich off of you!"
Bender, Maybe so but you are his sworn enemy. I challenge you to a battle of the chefs.
Hermes," Oh. Well, nice talking to you."
Bender," Fry? Leela? You're in there, too? Blech."
Leela, Amy?
Bender," Alright, take it. Sheesh!"
Farnsworth," Obsessing won't help, Bender. Take a lean back and enjoy life."
Leela," What? Are you talking? Oh, God! I'm deaf!"
Fry," Oh, and the aftertaste!"
Fry, Does it really work?
Hermes, It also shocks you when you lie.
Bender, We will fight them on the beaches! We will fight them on the glaciers!
Leela," Oh, no! The monks! We forgot to let them out of the laundry room."
Fry," So it's left, left, right-- Wait! I have a better idea! I'll go out and get her the perfect Xmas present. Something so great she'll never want to be unhappy again."
Leela," I think it's Blotto, that gangster I saw when my patch fell off. Professor? Where were you at 10pm last night?"
Fry," Is that how you say ""Zoidberg""?"
Amy, May stars in heaven bless your love!
Leela, Just like old times. Gosh! The bars on the windows seemed so much thicker back then. Mr. Vogel? Remember me?
Leela, Wait! What about the animals?
Zoidberg, You can drink with me maybe?
Fry," Well, why is– those things?"
Fry," You alright, Bender?"
Leela, Delivery boy? I must have mixed up the chips. It's a simple mi--
Fry, Sounds about right.
Leela, Good to see you.
Farnsworth," Oh, God, I'm dead! Well, no matter. Thank you all for coming. I don't recognise any of you, nor can I recall why I am here. Now, without further ado, a film highlighting Planet Express Inc.'s latest fiscal year."
Bender, Yes. All except this part.
Leela, The toaster's not working right either.
Farnsworth, None too soon. While you were gone the Trotters held a news conference to announce that I was a jive sucker. Behold! My invincible nuclear mutants.
Fry," How can you people be so blasé? Here you are in the year 3000 or so, yet you just sit around like it's the boring time I came from."
Fry," All right, all in. Yes! Four aces!"
Leela, Can't we get away in the ship?
Bender, So? I'm already super-strong. And my arms do this. Also I got this going.
Amy, We're talking about robosexual marriage.
Bender," Chairman-san, I came here with one goal  To humiliate Elzar in a large stadium. I believe I've done that."
Fry, Eww! look at her!
Bender, Chicken. Water. Fire. You take it from there.
Fry, Under the seat.
Fry," It didn't work. I'm the Dark One, and it didn't do anything."
Fry," Yeah, yeah. But I can't pass up a chance to learn the answers to the greatest questions of all time. Is it true that postage stamp glue is made of--"
Fry, You'll barely regret this!
Leela," We've got to do something. Bender, maybe you can interface with the Femputer and reprogram it to let them go."
Bender, I'll get the water boiling!
Amy, C'mon. Leela's not the type to hold a grudge.
Fry, Ew! What smells like boot feet?
Fry, Really? Whew! That's a load off my toad.
Fry," Six, seven, eight. Lock the gate. One, two, three. Turn the key. 30, 50, 10. My dirty, shifty friend?"
Leela, Ooh! I'll take a dozen.
Bender, Ever been beaten up by a guy dressed like a chick?
Leela," Fry, she's pulling down billionaire trust-fund money."
Fry, Wait! We could hide you. We'll pile fruit on you and claim you're a bowl.
Leela," Fry, you're Bender's best friend. How could you let that mob kick him out?"
Bender, Zilcho. No sign of life or intelligence. (Telepathically)  Just like Fry on a date.
Leela," The point is, one vote can make a difference and even though it won't, I'm still taking you to get registered."
Farnsworth," Yes, to the lavish Mafia-style villa of the Donbot."
Leela, I didn't hit the batter! For once I was pitching and not just belly-itching!
Fry, With you blocking the only escape route? Don't be silly.
Bender," Oh, yeah? Watch this!"
Bender, You got the toenail! Oh!
Fry, But this is Lucy Liu! Perhaps the only good actress of the 21st century! She's more than just a piece of software.
Leela, Now you stay away from those puffin twins.
Leela, Whoa! You guys have issues.
Fry," I don't know, Bender. Why do you ask? Were the other boys making fun of you?"
Bender," So does my butt, but I don't frame it and put it on the wall! Although-- What's that?"
Leela, We're a delivery company!
Leela," At the risk of sounding negative  No! Look, Professor, I can't participate in this mission."
Leela," Shut up, Fry. Now look, Adlai. I'm proud to be different. And I just wished I'd realised that when I was her age."
Fry," Hey, buddy, I'm from the same time as you. Remember that song, Safety Dance?"
Leela, Don't worry! I'll be fine! They know something about me and I've got to find out what. The lake didn't mutate me. What is going on here?
Fry," Come on, it'll be fun! Maybe we could even drink a little fortified wine."
Zoidberg, Why would I wanna know?
Leela," Fry, I'm so glad I didn't kill you."
Fry," Uh, just so we'll know, who's the enemy?"
Fry," So, Colleen, you look really nice."
Leela, Bender! Did you just round up our dates at the bus station?
Fry," But, how is that possible?"
Leela," Professor, you don't have to get back together with Mom. You just have to seduce her, get her bra off, and use the remote to deactivate the robots."
Leela," It's about some cute, little creatures from a land called Rumbledy-Hump. Kids, let's meet the Humplings! And laugh and learn and smile and think and other happy things."
Amy," Professor, what's not happening?"
Hermes, That's Leela!
Farnsworth," Come on, Guenter, take the hat."
Leela, Yeah. And I could afford it all if I didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler.
Amy," If you want to save $2, we could switch bodies."
Farnsworth," Oh, my!"
Fry, I can't let this happen. She'll never be happy without me.
Amy, It's from the list of words you almost never say.
Leela," Oh, Fry! I love what you've become."
Leela," Oh, OK."
Fry, Pst. There's that robot child actor who grew up and robbed a convenience store!
Farnsworth, Hmm. There's something wrong with your story but I can't put my finger on it. Of course! You don't have friends!
Zoidberg," Is it Planet Express, master?"
Farnsworth, You young turks think you know everything. I was inventing things when you were barely turning senile.
Fry," People of New New York, take a lesson from the 20th century. Stop all this pain-in-the-ass recycling and throw your garbage on the floor."
Farnsworth, Ooh!
Farnsworth, It'll seem even nicer once you've seen your room.
Bender, So a couple of animals didn't die and Leela got lucky. That's what I call a successful mission!
Farnsworth," You heard the good news, everyone! Save the Earth, et cetera, et cetera! Bye!"
Leela, We found it! The honeycomb hideout.
Leela, Bender's flying too low! And he's upside-down!
Leela, We're out of control. We're heading straight into the electric field!
Fry, My legs!
Leela," The dog's good, but our real competition is the Hypno-Toad. Your turn, Nibbler, honey. Herd those sheep!"
Hermes, Ah. Last night's tape. It was right next to Bathroom Bloopers 4.
Leela, Look at all these guys. Do you have any idea what the average length of their reigns was?
Fry," Professor, I've never seen you so cheerful. What the hell's wrong with you?"
Farnsworth," Come now, Fry!  You can't live out this sick fantasy!  Not without our help."
Leela, Yep.
Farnsworth," We could but we won't! It's a spaceship, damnit, not a prom limousine! If anyone needs me I'll be in the Angry Dome."
Leela, Rednecks!
Amy," Oh, my God! Bender, it's your thingy!"
Fry, Hey! That's not a nice thing to say.
Leela," Fry, that's the sweetest, most wonderful-- Wait! Recently? Like since you ate that toilet sandwich?"
Zoidberg, Hubert... I'm sorry. Wha?! He doesn't have hair. Great Little Caesar's ghost!
Farnsworth," All my life I've been inspired by great minds. Euclid, Copernicus, Braino. And my personal role model, Leonardo da Vinci."
Leela, Mine's not working!
Farnsworth," Oh, that guy, you know, I forget his name."
Fry," OK, OK, never mind. I'll just ask those people for directions."
Bender," Ah, that Ship is so white bread!"
Leela, Are you crazy? They worked thousands of people to death to make these stupid monuments.
Fry, Good Lord! What is this?
Leela," Honestly, that went better than I expected."
Leela," It's just that you've never called it that before, but okay."
Fry, What's happening?
Farnsworth, Ow! Not so rough!
Leela, The Nimbus! We're saved!
Leela, Fry! Although I suppose we could go for a walk along the beach.
Fry, My God! Poor Leela.
Zoidberg, From glen to glen and down--
Leela," Okay. Just filing alphabetically. A, B, C, D... Oh, this requires a little extra thought. I'm a natural."
Leela, You jerk. Why'd you have to drag us along?
Bender, Damn. One rock short of rescue!
Fry, It's hopeless! I can hear all this great music in my head but my stupid hands can't keep up.
Fry, Pft! What kind of bozos would start a Bender protest group?
Amy, Professor Katz's last name is Katz. Do you think he has something to do with these cats?
Amy, I know whose funeral we'll be attending next!
Farnsworth, How do you people do it? How do you go on knowing there's nothing more to know?!
Bender, He's whippin' angels now.
Fry," Can you save Hermes, Dr. Goodensexy?"
Bender," No doubt about it, this place is haunted."
Leela," Actually, I meant that to be the less preferable alternative. We can either chant slogans or we can take action."
Leela, I deserve this. And more. Keep it coming!
Leela," Fry, listen to yourself. You've been brainwashed."
Zoidberg, Friends! Help! A guinea pig tricked me! What?
Bender," I can't live without you. If you let go, I let go!"
Farnsworth," Perhaps we could explode the whole damned nebula. What do you think, Curly Joe?"
Leela, Hmm. Bender must have a pent-up need to bend that's not being satisfied by his bend-free lifestyle.
Leela," Happy housewarming, Fry! It's a miniature fruit salad tree."
Farnsworth," Oh, great news, everyone."
Fry, On account of it's like he's floating in a jar?
Bender," Uh, there's obviously been some sort of a mistake here. I'm sure there's-- I say I'm sure there's-- That is, I'm sure there's ... a very ... reasonable--"
Bender, You who?
Leela, I'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean madness.
Hermes, Exactly. You can't make that kind of stuff up.
Leela," Fry, swallow your food. Then talk."
Fry," Uh, I can't get any lower than this."
Farnsworth, Like a cheap French harlot.
Fry," Hey! You have no right to criticise the 20th century. We gave the world the lightbulb, the steamboat and the cotton gin."
Bender," When I screamed ""help"" I didn't mean you!"
Leela, No!
Bender," Come on, universe, you big, mostly empty wuss! Gimmie all the juice you got! Oh, mama!"
Leela," Hey, Zapp!"
Fry, To think I borrowed money from you!
Fry," I nominate That Guy. Not just because he has a suit but because he knows about business and stuff and he has a tie. My shares still count if they went through the washing machine, right?"
Farnsworth, No!
Leela, Just be cool. Nobody knows we're super-powerly challenged.
Leela, Popplers are intelligent. This one called me mama.
Leela," Hey, Fry."
Fry, We don't need it anymore. Yivo proposed. We're moving in with shkler.
Fry, Can I pull up my pants now?
Zoidberg," Just because you were in the swamp, doesn't necessarily mean—"
Fry," Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, who drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled Zorn the Stagnant..."
Bender, Wait. Make that four cigars.
Bender, Who are you?
Fry, You guys go ahead. I gotta find the bartender and deliver this box of barstool softener.
Farnsworth," Ah, Zoidberg. We've known each other so long that... Sometimes, I don't think we even need words to understand each other."
Farnsworth, Shut your mouth.
Bender, The sparks keep me warm.
Bender," Yeah, you did."
Bender," Hey, what happened to the TV?"
Fry, Not one place even remotely liveable.
Fry, Uh...
Fry," It's okay, Leela. This is all my fault, sort of. If this will save you, then, please, turn me into a virus milkshake."
Zoidberg," Oh, no! That's my-- Gotcha!"
Farnsworth, I may as well jump. Those sleazy naked scammers make me look like a chump.
Leela, It's even a crummy hologram.
Leela," Zoidberg, you set us free! I feel like I could stand to hug you! I can't, but you know what I'm trying to say."
Leela, Me? Perfectly normal?
Bender," Oh, no! What will I mix with my Scotch?"
Fry," Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows what happens in a black hole. It's possible she's still alive in another dimension somewhere. Right, Professor?"
Leela," I can't believe TiVo suggested that piece of... Ow! Come on, Hermes. Surely you have the authority to remove this damn collar."
Amy, What?
Farnsworth, Three.
Leela, Lars? He doesn't have it. He never had it. Fry had it!
Fry, FERTILE? What does that mean?
Fry, How'd you do that?
Leela," Well, I guess every adult wants to be a kid again sometimes. But I worked hard to be the person I am."
Amy," Imagine, if you will..."
Leela," Well, you know, it's just for a package delivery service."
Hermes, Everybody out!
Leela, What's going on here?
Leela," Uh, this is Professor Hubert Farnsworth. He escaped."
Bender," Yeah, when are you going to make a second Simpsons Movie? D'oh!"
Fry," It'd be deeper, but I'm standing on a gopher."
Leela, I'm not really in the mood.
Farnsworth, Hundred and ... what? Ooh!
Fry, I couldn't help it. She loved me because of the part of me that's a slob and I loved her because of the part of me that's desperate.
Hermes, Dread my locks! A fully-evolved robot human.
Leela, Next time I'm keeping it.
Bender," Cool! Cool! I bet a lot of people pray to you, huh?"
Leela," I don't know how to say this, Fry, but Bender is doomed to drift through space ... forever."
Bender, ...Don't crush me into an anchor...
Hermes, Phew! I've been sweating the nomenclature all week.
Hermes, It's too late. The inspector will be here in exactly one second.
Farnsworth," Why, you're just a big kid, aren't you, Zoidberg?"
Bender," No one, baby! Lucy Liu is the only girl for Bender."
Fry," So quiet! So peaceful! Time to lower my guard even for a minute. A heart attack! Yup, I was right."
Fry, Couldn't hurt.
Bender, What? What's going on?
Bender, Problem solved  You two fight to the death and I'll cook the loser. Work his gut; I like it tender.
Leela, Whoa! I wish this moment could last forever.
Farnsworth," And, Fry, you've got that brain thing."
Bender," My God, Fry! Just 'cause the guy's got a beard you label him as evil? Well I got a label for you, pal  An ugly little word called ""prejudice""."
Zoidberg, But how?
Bender," OK, Mister...?"
Fry, Let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it.
Farnsworth," The wha? Oh, Halley's Comet, of course. The only sufficient source of ice cubes that don't have bugs in them."
Leela, Watch out! His belly is shaking like a bowl full of nitro-glycerine!
Zoidberg, You Latins are so hot-blooded! This one's like a summer guy!
Bender, Sí.
Fry," Jeez! Walk much, Gedgie?!"
Bender," Hey, I could have done that if you'd asked me."
Bender," Well, let's find something comfy to bed down on."
Farnsworth," I believe this paradoicality equation to be unsolvable, ergo time travel is impossible. But I can't quite prove it, Bubblegum. Perhaps you and your razzle dazzle Globetrotter calculus could ..."
Leela," We're fighting back and you're helping us, you fat holiday idiot."
Fry, Cool! What's my job gonna be?
Bender, Death to humans!
Amy," Professor Farnsworth, you're a scientist!"
Zoidberg, Behold! The dance of peace!
Amy, What does 'e have on you?! Why have you kept 'im around all these years when 'e's so grossly incompetent?!
Leela, No.
Bender, Not this one. He blew all his money on instant lottery tickets.
Farnsworth, Just when all hope was lost...
Leela, So the eggs in that egg salad sandwich were--
Bender, I never should have thrown out the manual.
Bender, And otherwise I can never die?
Leela, We're hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6 from extinction. And if you could just--
Farnsworth, Yes! And I begged Zoidberg to put me out of my misery! Bring 'im! Quickly!
Leela, What is really going on?
Farnsworth, Or a big fat placebo. It's all the same crap.
Amy, My Kiffie called? Kif?
Leela," I'll find Fry's coffin, get his corpse and keep it under my mattress to remind me that he's really dead. That'll prove I'm not insane."
Bender, They're giving out the minor technical awards. I think they're up to writing.
Farnsworth, Ooh! I'm going to check out that math lecture. All this knowledge is giving me a raging brainer!
Fry, Dork alert!
Fry, Sure. Lots of people did.
Fry, Who wants pop-tarts? Uh-oh!
Bender, Humans are dumb and they die easy!
Hermes, Very well. I nominate the Professor.
Farnsworth," It's a coin slot. Bender, insert that giant nickel."
Bender, Then why do I have to be careful?
Bender, Whee!
Leela," OK, I'm insane! But I'm still sane enough to know it. The only time I feel alright is in my dreams, with you. Three spoonfuls. Then I can dream forever. One. Two Here goes. Goodbye, waking world."
Fry, Yes! I stopped the crime without shooting you. The oracle was wrong!
Bender," Well, you've come to the right place because Honest Bender's Orphanarium means discount orphans. Now, little lady. What do I have to do to send you home with 12 orphans today?"
Amy," Mom, Dad, I know this is weird but--"
Farnsworth, Cygnoids? On our block? Flying foo! They should go back where they came from.
Farnsworth, All death spheres have one vulnerable opening.
Zoidberg," Hermes, please. You can't hurry a delicate operation like this."
Fry," Bender, I can't take much more of this! I want outta here!"
Fry," Back in my day we didn't have your fancy all-digital weapons, but we still managed to kill each other just fine."
Fry," He decided not to let go. I can't believe you're gone. I won't! If I can't reach you physically, I'll just have to try something desperate and crazy!"
Fry," Can you find him, Professor?"
Fry, Everyone stop! He's not gonna hurt you.
Amy," Hey, you know what'd cheer you up? You should get a puppy."
Farnsworth," Thank you. I must say, I'm so proud to see what you've blossomed into since I first created your ancestors."
Hermes," Aw, what kind of father would I be if I said no?"
Amy," Oh, this isn't right."
Fry," No, I mean the singed flesh, I can smell it! And those lilacs on the table."
Leela," Ah, that must be my old boss."
Leela, It's like some kind of weird Leela museum ... and I'm the Leela!
Farnsworth, What's going on here?
Fry, But an hour ago this pizza's still luke warm. Zero zero one one zero ...
Farnsworth, The time came for our first delivery.
Bender, Hello? This is Flexo.
Leela," Well, you downloaded Lucy Liu. Are you just going to stare vacantly at her and not say anything?"
Zoidberg, He's bluffing. Ouch!
Leela, Grab on!
Fry, Christmas. You know? X-M-A-S.
Hermes," Fry, no! The pressure will crush you like a green snake under a sugar cane truck."
Fry," What I'm tryin' to say is... In all the world, I couldn't find a diamond good enough for you. But then I found one out there... Among the stars. The beautiful, affordable stars."
Fry, Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the vapours!
Bender, I'm not looking!
Leela," Dismiss all charges? Your Honour, I know the case is closed and you've rendered your verdict, but I wanna testify."
Bender," So long, jerk."
Hermes, How?
Fry," Uh, yeah. Look at that exhaust fan."
Hermes, Look at you!
Bender, Only the greatest party ever! I don't need to have another party in my whole life. I am partied out!
Fry, Let's just forget about the box. The Professor said to stay away.
Bender," Jealous? Not while I have the love of Robo-Puppy here. Robo-Puppy, lick my cheek."
Fry," Uh, it's probably better if we don't know. Uh, mystery of life and whatnot."
Bender," All situations have the same Plan C. Bending, come on."
Farnsworth, We won't know that until you leave.
Zoidberg," They are mild. In fact, you're soaking in one right now."
Hermes," It won't turn. Push harder, Bender!"
Farnsworth, Good thing I secretly installed this wormhole in the table.
Fry," Bender, are you alright?"
Hermes, I'll have a horse coke.
Bender," Not just any bending unit, Presidente. I happen to be brilliant, fearless and short on cash."
Fry," Come on! Come on! Hey, Leela, how about a kiss for good luck? I meant tongue luck."
Fry," (reading) Who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed a soup composed principally of Throm the Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule with honour and insanity-- Uh, integrity!"
Leela," Don't hug me! I've done a horrible thing! For God's sakes, somebody teach me a lesson!"
Leela, Your face can take a lot of punishment. That's good to know.
Leela," This coming-together of superstars really means a lot to you, doesn't it, Bender?"
Amy, Everybody just calm down. Kif promised he'd catch the rustlers.
Farnsworth," You gotta dangle, Have a new angle, Wangle a new dangle on life,"
Bender, Psst! There I am!
Amy, Quiet. There's an ad coming on.
Fry, Hey!
Bender," Hi, I'm a naughty nurse and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute."
Fry, You remember when we first met?
Bender, The Pharaoh has spoken.
Farnsworth, It's a delivery for the Democratic Order Of Planets.
Farnsworth," Yes, it's a perfect scale model of the universe's largest bottle. I put a tiny spaceship inside to keep it from being boring."
Fry, You're the best friend I have left. An' I barely even know you.
Hermes, Let's make it interesting. Fetch down one of them sabres.
Leela, I can't!
Bender, What are you doing with that?
Fry, This show's been going downhill since season three.
Leela," No, Professor! It's a surprise party for your 150th birthday."
Fry," Uh, sorry."
Bender," Woohoo! Time to go clubbin'. Baby seals, here I come."
Bender," Me, please!"
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! Several years ago I tried to log on to AOL, and it just went through. Whee! We're online!"
Fry," Hey! When you look this good, you don't have to know anything."
Leela, No!
Bender," So, do you know what I'm gonna do before I do it?"
Bender," Hermes, old pal!"
Leela, Says who?
Fry, Whoa! Hey!
Zoidberg," Uh, excuse me? Which is the one people like to hug?"
Zoidberg, Go on without me faster!
Bender, And try one of these Popsicle sticks. They've absorbed quite a bit of flavour.
Leela, Then you're gonna have to sink to Bender's level. Stop acting like the Queen of England.
Fry, It worked!
Leela," Okay, team, these red-hot, razor-sharp fans are the only safe way into the mine."
Bender, You really are too picky.
Leela," Professor, there is nothing wrong with robosexuality."
Farnsworth," What an exquisite day. That azure sky, the verdant treetops. Those delightful birds with their chirp, chirp, chirp and their tweet, tweet, splat."
Fry, Wait a minute! I know what's going on here. You've all become idiots!
Fry, My God! He's become evil. I mean eviler!
Farnsworth," That's a bedspring, you dumb bedspring! There are no robot fossils!"
Leela, He's George Washington! He tends not to do that!
Leela, Quarter-shell.
Hermes, Shut your lockers and get to class. How's my body doing?
Farnsworth," The odour travels past this coffee stain here, around the olive pit and into this cigar burn. And this appears to be a doodle of myself as a cowboy. But the Smellescope is brilliant, I tell you! Think of the astronomical odours you'll smell thanks to me. Oh, my!"
Leela, ...is mating with you! These aren't tentacles. They're genticles.
Fry, Daylight and everything.
Farnsworth, Farnsworth? That's me! My doomsday device! So it was the scammers! They sawed off my hand and stole the doomsday device.
Farnsworth," Due to the lens' remarkable quark-lattice structure, it should be capable of unthinkable magnification! Come. Follow me to the lab."
Hermes, Sweet three-toed sloth of ice planet Hoth! She's awake!
Bender, Focus!
Amy, I don't care how much trouble I get in. I needed to feel my lips pressed against your lipless beak.
Amy, Really? Maybe it's just cute girls.
Leela, Do you two have to imitate everything you see on TV?
Fry, It's just like riding a bicyc--
Farnsworth, The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence.
Bender, Yes! Oh!
Leela," A tall doctor, you say?"
Fry," So, I'm gonna be a delivery boy?"
Bender, Quiet! I'm makin' out with a floozy! Hold your clapper. Someone's comin'!
Leela, Hmm. I have been looking for a way to serve the community that incorporates my violence. Let's do it!
Leela, Oh Lars! No blowing us up make me love you even more.
Leela, What is it? My God! Did you hear maracas?
Leela," Sabotage. This is a normal L-unit. Without it, space travel is but the fevered dream of a madman."
Fry," Jeez, Bender, you're scaring me. You're going wacko!"
Fry, Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six. Check.
Farnsworth, A pair of deviant robosexuals. Not under my roof!
Fry," No, really, I don't-- Mmm!"
Fry," Hey, guys."
Fry, Leela?!
Leela," Yeah, we're boned."
Bender, I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.
Fry, He's much worse. He drinks and smokes and he posts naked pictures of me on the Internet.
Leela, I unsubscribed yesterday.
Farnsworth," And you, Igner. The evil I could tolerate, but the stupidity..."
Fry, I said later!
Farnsworth, The key is to grab life by the hojos! Live every day like it might be your last.
Leela," Hey, guess what guys!"
Hermes," Oh, come on!"
Leela, We demand Bender!
Bender, Oy.
Bender," Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature, because I love you. Not in the way of the Ancient Greeks, but the way a robot loves a human, a human loves a dog and, occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty. I'm goin' in!"
Leela," Fry, you have to be more careful. We're not in the 20th century. You don't know how things work here."
Zoidberg, I'm serious. He's a terrible person.
Hermes, Sweet robot swan of Botswana!
Zoidberg," Oh, right! And there was a giant killer space whale."
Leela," Oh, Adlai, I've had a wonderful time today. No one's stared at me or avoided staring at me or tried to burn me. You make me feel so not weird."
Bender," Alright lets make this quick, I'm due at the opening of a mini-mall. Hey what is this?"
Bender," Thank you, steward. Wiggles, weren't you about to propose a toast to your gallant captain?"
Leela, Violent outbursts.
Bender," Well, well, well. Look who decided to show up."
Hermes, Look! The bone vampire!
Bender," Hey, sorry you got sent to that South American Turkish prison instead of me on account of mistaken identity."
Fry," Uh, how far is it?"
Fry, Not covered!
Bender," Nah, those lousy Moochers cleaned out our pantry. All they left was baking soda and capers. And here it is!"
Fry, Eh.
Amy," Kif, I'd love to live with you ... someday. But before then there's still lots I wanna do on my own. What was that?"
Fry," Uh, you're present may need some assembly."
Fry," For starters, only use quality ingredients. Case in point  No more live bees. Oregano works equally well. And when you put pizzas in the oven, don't get in with them."
Bender," Yes! In your face, Gandhi!"
Fry," Hey, uh, where's my suitcase? Ow!"
Farnsworth," Ah! Then without further stalling for time, I present to the Nobel judges the first robot ever turned into a human."
Bender," Yeah that broke, alright!"
Bender, Oh.
Farnsworth, Gotcha!
Leela," Oh, I get it. This is cute. You're jealous of Bender's new friend!"
Fry," No way! I'm not letting my best friend get recycled. Not for five cents, not for five hundred cents! Leela, I've got a plan!"
Fry," Yeah, you look different. Did you get a haircut?"
Fry, Ow!
Hermes," Well, if I know anything about which number is bigger than the other number, I'd say that--"
Farnsworth," Oh, right! I'll have a croque monsieur, the paella, two mutton pills and a stein of mead."
Leela," Uh, guys, I don't know how to tell you this, so I'll just let Fry blurt it out thoughtlessly."
Fry, But-But how do I know who's the human and who's the robot?
Hermes, Everyone got along so well today.
Amy," No, Bender!"
Fry, Who's it going to?
Zoidberg, I wasn't wearing it. I was eating it.
Leela," Thanks, Colonel."
Bender," Roger that, I got a map of the ship right here."
Bender," Xmas dinner, everyone."
Bender, Nope. Watching cartoons.
Leela, But it's doing long-term damage to the planet.
Zoidberg, They're missing out on some hot pickle action.
Amy, Yes! Stop asking!
Fry," You're going back or the Countess, aren't you?"
Fry," Oh, Bender. You didn't touch the Crushinator, did you?"
Leela, What did he say?
Bender," Great. First he steals my body, now he's touching my stuff."
Fry, Amy Wong!
Bender," Yes, sir, sirdy-sir-sir-sir!"
Fry, Aaah!  I'm sick of my head doing things! Leela!
Leela, Fry?
Fry, The ship? But you just started dating.
Bender," Alright. ""Hands in the air"" rhymes with ""Just don't care"" and ... finished! Eck! Smells like something died in the wall!"
Bender," Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that."
Fry, Aha! Oops!
Bender," I said, ""Wow chica wow wow""."
Leela, Why don't you just walk? He was only about 20 yards from here.
Fry, Yeah.
Leela, I don't understand what you mean!
Bender, Yes! Let's stay there tonight.
Bender," I said ""eat""! Come on, mange!"
Farnsworth," Damn straight! Today, the mad scientist can't get a doomsday device, tomorrow it's the mad grad student. Where will it end?"
Farnsworth," I've hit a rich vein of missing links. Java Man, Piltdown Man, Manfred Mann. Eureka! It's the elusive missing missing link! This will show Banjo, once and for all!"
Farnsworth," No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm lying to make her feel better!"
Leela, It's unbearable! How much do you think it would cost to get my tongue removed?
Bender," Interesting. No, wait, the other thing ... tedious."
Leela," Now we can't land on the surface because those robots will kill Fry and me, so we'll have to stay up here and lower you with the winch. And remember  You don't know humans, you don't work for humans, and above all, you don't like humans!"
Leela, Nibbler? Poopsie-doodle?
Bender," Aw, crap, singing. Mind if I smoke?"
Fry," Listen, Leela, let me make it up by taking you out to dinner tonight."
Fry, Any effect?
Bender," Hey, you wouldn't hit a guy with X-Ray glasses would you? Ow! Easy on the arm! Oh! Oh, my ass!"
Fry," Come on, boy, jump! Good boy!"
Farnsworth, Me!
Bender," Nah, don't ruin it. I'm lovin' the hypocrisy. It's like catchin' an evangelist in a whorehouse. That was the best Christmas ever."
Leela, Great! Now we're being crushed.
Bender," Hmm. Ah, a picture of my mommy."
Hermes, Worthless.
Bender," Nine, ten, fire. Yes, I got him! Wohoo!"
Farnsworth, Until 5pm?
Fry, It's just a cold! What's the big deal?
Hermes, What's all this cat hair on my sweater?
Fry, I've got a date. She'll be along any minute.
Bender," Why you selfish little bastards, Do you want the kids to think that Santa's just a crummy, empty-handed jerk?"
Bender, Only one way to find out.
Hermes," I'm from Jamaica, the ""Show Me"" island. So show me you're blowing it out your fanny."
Fry," Sir, with me around, they'll be the least of your worries."
Bender, Has humanity called?
Hermes, Tally me banana.
Farnsworth," Oh, Cubert, come in here. I have something amazing to show you."
Bender," I sure was. Make a hole, chumps. Presenting our new masters!"
Bender," Yes, Malachi, what is it this time?"
Leela," We crashed on an uncharted planet.  When I woke up, I was pinned under this tree. Can you help me?"
Leela," I know you're trying to mask your pain with humour, but don't worry. I'm sure the Professor can clone you a new nose."
Leela, Like what?
Farnsworth, There he is again!
Leela," OK, is everyone ready?"
Fry," Giant Space Robot, this is Captain Fry of the USS Planet Express Ship. We come in peace."
Bender, I will. I will.
Bender," So it's a cake you want, is it? I'll make you a cake you'll never forget."
Amy, Hooray!
Zoidberg, Hey! I'm trying to sleep in here!
Hermes," OK, Fry!"
Zoidberg," Oh, sure, like you need all your blood."
Fry, Which means we can clone it! Seymour will live again!
Leela," If I may offer some constructive criticism, there was never any real peril. I mean, the delivery guy has, like, 30 superpowers."
Fry, So you flip out and start acting like some crazy folk singer?
Zoidberg," Yes. The same jerk that once noshed on me like a shrimp toast. Now, who's getting 'is pineal gland extracted? Ah, yes. This contains a concentrated form of the Yeti neurotoxin."
Bender," Aw, man. Why do you gotta be so oracle-y?"
Bender," Now that's hospital dancing. Pretty good, eh, Calcky?"
Bender, Quick! Let's keep escaping!
Fry," Well, I sort of a have a thing for this girl I work with."
Leela, A little. That's why I've decided to hurt you until you explain it.
Farnsworth, Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a scientist.
Bender," Oh, my God! Look! It's Bigfoot!"
Fry, Because I'm so smart?
Fry, I'll take care of this.
Leela, I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer.
Leela," Shut up, Zoidberg!"
Bender," Uh, while you're at it, could you touch up this seam?"
Bender," OK, everyone, come and get it!"
Fry, Please?
Farnsworth," Oh, fuff! Nothing in the universe can fracture diamondium. Not even God 1 an' God 2 put together. But behold! The tail is composed of abrasive comet powder. And that's just what I need to put a washday shine on my new Doomsday device. Now hop in the flivver and score me some o' that sweet, sweet powder."
Farnsworth, Between a minute and a billion years.
Fry, That's great! What's the little guy's name?
Fry," Yeah, I wanna see that."
Farnsworth," If my calculations are correct, this garbage ball will knock the other garbage ball directly into the sun."
Farnsworth," I didn't say anything about animals. Now it seems that the planet will collapse within three days. Incidentally, this will kill all the animals."
Zoidberg, Money!
Hermes," Yes, but you only stamped it four times!"
Bender," That's her right there, with the ""I'm gonna kill you Bender"" look in her eye."
Fry, That's one small step for Fry--
Leela," Uh, Professor...?"
Bender, What about on the roof?
Leela, I wouldn't feel so bad if Bender just understood the pain he caused me.
Leela," Yes, my lord. Amy and Nibbler are a tewwible thweat. They must be spayed and neutered, wespectivewy."
Zoidberg, And Zoidberg picks up another piece. The crowd goes wild! What is?
Fry, I'll be there.
Zoidberg," There you go, dearies."
Fry," Well, rest assured, Leela's the only girl for me."
Bender," OK, I've constructed an elaborate lie  I'll call Angle-ine while pretending to be Flexo, arrange a date, show up disguised as him and catch her two-timing me with myself."
Leela, It is. I know it is.
Farnsworth, Ow. Ow. Ow. I'm a genius. Ow. Ow.
Bender," Fry, I've never asked you for anything before but, if it's not too much trouble, when it comes to the ninth round just let him win."
Farnsworth," A hundred years ago he was my most promising student at Mars University. But then, after one fateful pop-quiz..."
Fry, Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway? Are you expecting something to happen with your Valentine's date?
Fry, All kinds.
Bender," No, I'm going to chop off my antenna."
Fry, I did do the nasty in the past-y!
Hermes, Three decades of the munchies beat you to it.
Fry, I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's gonna drink me. Quit it!
Hermes," Damn it, woman! You are makin' me highly Selassie."
Fry," Mmm, let me get some of that suckling pig."
Leela, He's too far out! We can't reach him!
Bender, There's gas in our ass.
Zoidberg," Wait! People of Earth, listen. Yes, I'm desecrating a flag. But to preserve the freedom it represents!"
Hermes, That's true. If only there were a way to have one party for both of you here at the office then write it off as a business expense. Wait! I thought of a way! The way I just said!
Amy, Dude! An ancient sunken city!
Fry," Leela, we may not have much time left ... ... so let's spend all of it reminiscing about Bender. He was like a big computer that ran on magic."
Leela, Go consummate yourself.
Hermes, At least there's only one of 'em. The good news is they can't start breedin'.
Leela," That's it! I warned you. Fry, Zoidberg, I now pronounce you man and—"
Farnsworth," Go, bodysuit, go!"
Fry, You were right. I don't know what it's like to be a mutant. But I want to know.
Bender," Well, life goes on. Except for you!"
Farnsworth," Quickly! If we turn the ratchet the other way, perhaps we can restart the Earth."
Hermes, Those robo-cavemen have kidnapped our human regular-women!
Farnsworth," Oh, did I ever tell you how I used to own that ship?"
Zoidberg, Then mating.
Bender, I must've killed him. He's my best friend and I killed him. I never felt so empty inside.
Hermes," Stop resisting, my brethren! Don't you want to be part of something bigger than yourselves? Like a big crazy monster?"
Leela, Yes.
Zoidberg, More! More! More! More!
Leela, Of course.
Leela," Oh, yeah? Well, shut up, cane boy!"
Leela," Professor, We need to talk to you about Fry."
Amy, What happens if the fire goes out?
Farnsworth," Come, Bender. It's time to go home and rest. I need you in top shape next week when I present you to the Nobel Prize Committee. Bender?"
Bender," Psst, there it is."
Bender," Clumsy bludgeoning, please."
Hermes," No, no, no."
Leela," Wow, I never realised the first astronauts were so fat!"
Fry," Oh, my God! They dug up a bag of olestra chips from my time! There must be layers and layers of old stuff down there."
Bender," Ah! I got a good vibe from this place  Nice long dinner table, quiet, well-behaved spiders, graveyard-adjacent. Yep! It's gonna be--"
Bender, Now to find Emperor Von Richendoof.
Bender, Tough luck!
Fry, Ow!
Fry, But the air is green and there's no sign of civilisation whatsoever.
Zoidberg," Be careful with that Adlai, Leela, he's a doctor, they're very poor."
Fry, Making the noise.
Fry, That seemed unnecessary.
Fry, In the hospital. The ambulance took you here right after the bee stung you.
Fry, I am so unlucky! I've run over black cats that were luckier than me.
Bender, Countess? Countess?
Fry, I'm walking on sunshine! Sunshine!
Bender," No, it isn't."
Fry, I burned my finger.
Fry," Yeah, OK."
Fry," Bender, wake up! He's OK! Quick, does anyone have any liquor?"
Fry," He's right, Bender. Please, take your little pink sword and go home. {Fry did not say shklee here.}"
Farnsworth, She's right!
Fry, But we have to! The world needs Star Trek to give people hope for the future.
Leela, You mean the ship?
Fry, But it was my life.
Bender, Already taken care of.
Bender, OMG! Being chicks is so much fun.
Leela," Fry, delete that! Delete that right now!"
Fry, What does it do?
Zoidberg, Goodbye.
Fry," Ocean madness. Yeah, right. It's always something, ain't it? It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here! Wake up! Oh! oxygen!"
Bender," OK, kids. It's 9.00, you know what that means. Daddy's sick of looking at you so go to bed. The grown-ups have to talk. Come on, Ma."
Bender," I was working the long con all along. While sawing off the professor's hand with an extremely dull saw, I had some time to think. So I asked myself, ""Who could use a doomsday device more? The scammers or me, Bender?"". After several minutes of sawing, I knew the answer. Me, Bender. So I retrieved the dummy satchel ..."
Fry, Ow!
Bender," No, I just told the robot company I was defective."
Leela," OK, thanks, Bender. Let's fan out and look for him."
Farnsworth, I'm with Bender. Whatever was here's been covered by centuries of ice buildup.
Bender," Quick, Fry! Run for it!"
Amy," Why didn't you just leave a message, sweetie?"
Leela," Well, I got through the night and no one looked in the box. Not even me. The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it. A whole evening of TV gone. What a mockery of justice that I can't take even a little tiny peek. I need coffee. OK, heads I look, tails I don't. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah! Heads! I mean, alright then. No! I have a duty not to look. Well, then again, I promised the coin I would. Oh, it's deep. Deeper than a small box should be."
Hermes, Any new business?
Leela, You're not registered?
Farnsworth, I fear I may not survive this war reenactment. I can't believe we’re only twelve feet from the parking lot.
Bender, Translation  Boring! That's a good one! Ow!
Bender," Here you go, Fry."
Fry," Cool! Y'know, I've never even seen a robot's apartment before."
Amy, It sure was.
Bender, With gusto.
Leela, Not really.
Zoidberg," Oh, right, right, with the bones! I always forget about the bones."
Bender," Oh, so this is suddenly all about you. Sheesh!"
Leela," Look, Fry, I'd like to help you but it's my wedding and I'm kind of busy. Here. Try to be happy for me. That way at least one of us will be."
Bender," Aw, jeez."
Amy, Don't worry. I'll hit the fuel guzzler!
Amy," Oh, me too!"
Farnsworth, There'll never be another like him. Let's hire someone better!
Bender, Hey! Maybe you could lend me a hand with these deliveries.
Leela, Alright. Which of you space dogs has the guts and know-how to harpoon that whale?
Farnsworth," I'm poking as hard as I can! I'm sorry, Fry, but I'm afraid Leela is in an irreversible coma."
Leela, Is that a cooking show?
Bender, Is the Space Pope reptilian?
Farnsworth," Neither, Fry. It was science. Bender's mighty imagination amplified by a dark matter resonance created an alternate reality that very nearly blew our minds."
Farnsworth, Fine! Get going!
Amy, Huh?!
Farnsworth," Well, that doesn't mean that no one is coming or that you two are total losers. Who gave you that idea?"
Fry, Holy camolies! The house I grew up in. It's still there!
Fry," Then I'll prove I'm alive, by telling you something only I could know. There's a surprise for you in my locker. I got it at a Swedish novelty shop before we left."
Leela," Don't yell at Nibbler like that. You hurt his feelings. Come on, pet him and make up."
Leela, I don't know which one to shoot.
Amy, I'm from Mars.
Farnsworth," Oh, great machine, we beseech thee. What if life were more like a video game?"
Leela, I guess we all saw what we wanted to see.
Fry, It's immense.
Fry," Hey, looky there."
Farnsworth, Ooh.
Fry," No, sir. We're amusement park patrons."
Zoidberg," Goodbye, friends. I'll miss you. Good riddance to them. Now Zoidberg is the popular one!"
Leela, How industrious!
Bender," Shut up and pay attention to me, Bender! Look, I love life and its pleasures as much as anyone here. Except perhaps you, Hedonismbot. But we need to be shut off! Especially you, Hedonismbot!"
Leela," Oh, right, how selfish of me. We'll just stay here forever. Hey, Fry? Remember that robot ""Bender""?"
Leela, Yeah!
Leela, Are you kidding me?
Fry," I got her champagne, I opened it. What does a guy have to do?"
Farnsworth," Behold once more, the mighty Clone-O-Mat! Requiring such vast amounts of electricity that we must harness the elemental power of nature itself. I speak, of course, of molten lava deep within the Earth's core. To the sub-basement!"
Fry, Mmm. There's nothin' wrong with a little fast food once or twice a meal. Heart... Attack! I'm fine.
Fry, What the hell is that?
Farnsworth," Really? Oh, dear."
Leela," That won't stop me! Raise the solar sails. I'm goin' after that ""Möbius Dick""."
Bender," Hey, look! The keys to the real spaceship."
Farnsworth," No, I'm wrong. The empathy chip was running at triple capacity."
Fry," Let me guess, he thinks he's Lincoln?"
Bender," Uh, I never got the change. Suckers."
Leela," Aww, thanks, guys. Pass the veal, please."
Leela," Oh, God! Not Zapp Brannigan!"
Bender," What part of ""nay"" doesn't thou understand?"
Fry," Alright, fine. Everything else sucks. At least we can have a nice place to live."
Farnsworth," And no more wasting fuel. From now on I'll be keeping a tight hold on the keys to the ship, swallowing them before I go to bed and recovering them the next morning."
Farnsworth, Don't you have a self-destruct button?
Bender, That sounds like a cry for help.
Leela," Well, our accommodations aren't great, but it sure is beautiful out here."
Fry, I wanna hear a space story!
Bender, You want some lemonade? You saw a big parade?
Fry, I was robbed. They got everything except these.
Fry," What happened, Santa?"
Leela," Yeah, that's what I thought. You are all surface."
Fry," Hey, why are those kids following you? Do you have candy stuck to your ass?"
Bender," Oh, shucks! I wasn't afraid of that robot. I'm pretty brave once you get past my macho exterior! It's an army of Lucy Lius!"
Fry, Leela's going nuts and I can't save her unless I learn more about her mysterious past. Isn't there anything else you can tell me?
Bender, It's a magical day.
Leela," Hmm, somebody must have turned down the gravity. I'll fix it for you."
Leela," Well, you heard the windbag  We've been drafted. Everyone into the ship."
Amy, I like how it's not killing us so far.
Zoidberg, I ask for rich guy stuff and you give me shiny pebbles? Bah! I bid you adieu.
Fry," Oh, uh, hello, sir. It's a lovely evening you have tonight. Um, I'm here to pick up your daughter."
Fry," Finally! Come on, Bender. Let's mosey!"
Zoidberg, I am? At last! Recognition!
Farnsworth," Um, business plan, uh, yes. I keep it here, right next to my heart."
Amy," Try and make me, copper."
Leela," Well, if we get bored looking for the clover, I've got Tetris on this thing."
Bender," Single Female Lawyer, Having lot's of sex-- (talking) Huh?"
Leela, I'm in!
Bender, Outta the way!
Fry, Don't wait for me.
Leela," Cool your jowls, Nixon. You may not like it that Dr. Zoidberg desecrated a flag. You might even find the image of it festering in his bowels somehow offensive. But the right to freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Earth Constitution."
Farnsworth, It can't be real--
Farnsworth," Enough good ones, everyone. We have a delivery to an Alien space giant."
Leela, I am...
Leela," Oh, please. You forgot me quick enough when you met Colleen."
Fry," Hey, tell me something  You've got all this money, how come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?"
Bender, What a waste.
Fry, I knew 'e cared about us!
Bender," Pft! Yeah, at our wedding!"
Fry," Bender, you did it!"
Leela," Wait. If he's your clone, why doesn't his nose look like yours?"
Bender, Ten-times normal wage? I'll give those jerks what for!
Farnsworth, Stop!
Fry," Whoa, thanks! If you ever need a saviour again, just ask."
Fry, Cosmic F.
Bender," I think you misunderstood the concept of ""bendering time""!"
Zoidberg, Such noises!
Fry," But if anyone asks, say she's an alien."
Farnsworth, That was a disgusting story.
Fry," Oh, look, I'm not actually interested in her if that's what's bothering you."
Fry," Um... So... So, yeah, the thing is..."
Hermes, No.
Fry, You mean we just--
Fry, Happy Valentine's day.
Hermes, What was that big thing?
Bender, Le Grand Cigar! She is mine! And with absolutely no consequences.
Hermes, Fathers Against Rude Television don't want our kids watching Bender's high-definition filth.
Leela, But where can we find a substance the exact density and consistency as garbage?
Fry, Cyclops.
Amy," I don't know, I've had cow. Ew! Gross!"
Zoidberg, They sent us inside for doing an unsatisfactory job. And eating penguin eggs.
Fry," Wouldja look at that gem! Slap that shiner on a ring an' me an' Leela will be doing the married, horizontal Charleston in no time."
Leela, It's a scam!
Leela, Zapp?
Fry, We'll find that cold virus. The Nerd Search satellite was launched on the space shuttle and released into orbit.
Leela, Ta-da! The first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball. How do I look?
Fry, Here I come. Let me just-- One more taste.
Farnsworth," Yes, Bender?"
Bender," Okay, you're still clean. I mean metaphorically."
Farnsworth, Good Lord! I'm getting a reading of over 40 mega-Fonzies.
Leela," OK. If we're going to save Bender, we've got to look and act exactly like robots."
Leela, Well talk to her. Tell her about your feelings in an open an honest way.
Amy, Kif!
Fry," Don't worry, Professor, it's no competition for your death clock."
Leela, Then do it the wrong way.
Leela," No way! If you wouldn't take my help when you didn't need it, why should I give it to you now when you do need it?"
Hermes, Time for my four-twenty-one daiquiri!
Leela," You can count on us, Mr. Mayor. Justice away!"
Leela," Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship."
Hermes," Man, you are such a jokester!"
Fry," I don't think so! You two make me ashamed to call myself an idiot. There's always going to someone smarter than you, so the only way to be happy is to make the most of what you've got."
Bender, Get the hell off my planet.
Farnsworth, Wha?
Fry," Hey, that's the violet dwarf star that Leela wants to save."
Fry, We've got to get the old Bender back.
Fry, Underpants?
Zoidberg," See, this is how it starts. First with he jokes, then comes the heavy stuff."
Farnsworth," Yes, yes! Let's all talk to Zoidberg."
Leela," Careful with that doomsday device, Bender."
Bender," Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care, Cause the master's gone away."
Bender, Me.
Leela, What happened? Why am I in my apartment?
Fry, Wow! I love symposia.
Fry, I had the Professor analyse the Alienese letter that was found with you.
Bender, Never!
Leela, Sure. Bare hands or weapon?
Bender," Robo-Puppy truly is robot's best friend, huh?"
Bender," I'll make you cry, buddy! You're a pimple on society's ass and you'll never amount to anything."
Fry," Uh, coma. Sad."
Fry, Why would Nixon stay at the Watergate?
Hermes, You can do it!
Leela, Hi! It's great to be back. I think you'll enjoy this one.
Hermes," Stop it, mon!"
Zoidberg, Tell me about it.
Bender," Oh, no! I'm not going near it. Last time, that magnetic psycho nearly cut my head off."
Farnsworth," No, I'm here because a giant trash ball is heading straight for us. Smell for yourself."
Farnsworth," I'm sure that Bender has just made a cutting remark, but he doesn't know I taped over his soap operas to record this message."
Leela, Sure. I'll do it.
Leela," Hi, kids! What book would you like me to read first?"
Bender, Of course they're unheeded. How am I supposed to hear prayers coming out of my ass?
Bender," ""Pardon me, sir, but you seem to be bleh, bleh..."""
Leela," When I was an orphan, I always wished I could grow up with my mom and dad. And now, thanks to being hurled backwards in time--"
Leela, Relax. Everything'll be fine.
Amy," Smeesh, it's crowded!"
Zoidberg, Really? I'd better keep an eye out at the next meeting.
Fry, However huge it might be.
Zoidberg, We can only hope!
Fry, Maybe we hit a space cow.
Bender," And that's the story of how one of me became two and two became four, makin' seven total. The end."
Fry," Wait, Mount Rushmore and the Leaning Tower of Pisa? I didn't know they were both in New York!"
Bender," I wish I was stupid and violent. Then we'd see what's what, I'd pound him till--"
Hermes, Help! The stapler's collating me alive!
Hermes," Yes, but according to the Old Farmer's Wikipedia, the amazing thing about Kif's species is that the remains continue suffering for up to six hours after death."
Farnsworth," In a related matter, you'll be delivering this sack of children's letters directly to Santa at his death fortress on Neptune."
Fry, I don't get it. Is blernsball exactly the same as baseball?
Leela," Fry, distract him."
Bender, Freedom!
Fry," Oh, stupid TV! Bender! You're blind-stinking sober!"
Farnsworth," There, there. You're just having a mid-life crisis."
Zoidberg, Hmm. Hmm.
Leela," But tell us, how could a city with such a ... fabulous airport end up underwater?"
Hermes, Nay.
Bender," Hey, look, a safe!"
Farnsworth," Well, in those days Mars was just a dreary, uninhabitable wasteland, uh, much like Utah. But unlike Utah, it was eventually made livable, when the university was founded in 2636."
Leela, And what's your scientific basis for thinking that?
Fry, What the--
Amy," Spam. Spam. ""Hi. How are you?"" Oh, that must be from Kiffy."
Leela, I thought you snuck off to take a dump.
Fry, You're right. Nothing is over as long as there's one thin ray of hope.
Bender," Duh! Gee, Bender, how you gonna get through these bars? I dunno, moron, suppose I bend them? Duh, OK!"
Zoidberg, If you call that living.
Fry," Wait, you're a lawyer? You're hired!"
Farnsworth," Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin ... ... and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords, cruel though they may be a--"
Farnsworth, Same thing I teach every semester  The Mathematics of Quantum Neutrino Fields. I made up the title so that no student would dare take it.
Fry," What party do you belong to, Bender?"
Fry, Aha! My brother's grave!
Fry, I won't let you!
Zoidberg," Fry, you scoundrel!"
Bender," Coochie, coochie!"
Amy," Betsy! This is my sweet, little Betsy. I raised her from a larva that ate one of my sweaters."
Amy," Hey, Fry."
Leela," Let's see you beat it, Rastaman."
Farnsworth, I'm afraid the face you fell in love with was actually just a blob of living gunk I bought with my tax refund.
Fry, Hmmmm!
Bender," Let's just say I lucked-out at the track! Also, I rigged one race."
Fry, Cool! Can you turn into a race car?
Bender, Me too.
Bender," Shoot him, he's choking me!"
Bender," Garbage, huh? I'll take care of it."
Bender, He means you guys did it.
Farnsworth, How should I know? Just shut up and wait!
Leela, Really?
Fry, Way to bend it!
Hermes, Anyone spend the night together?
Leela, Open up!
Fry," This is great, Professor! We should go out and celebrate!"
Bender, C'mon!
Bender, Terrible shame that. Shall I do the honours?
Farnsworth," Hello, Mavis! Surprised to see me back again so soon?"
Amy," If I understand you correctly, I've seen the error of my ways?"
Leela," Stop! Stop shooting! It's me, Leela."
Amy," Remember, love between a human and a robot is taboo. We can't tell anyone, not even our co-workers."
Bender," Well, I'm off to the royal yacht for a quick seduce-and-snatch."
Bender," I know what this is about. My body loved me, and I turned it's back on it. Well, old friend, tie a yellow ribbon round your neck, 'cause I'm a-comin' home!"
Fry, I did it! And it's all thanks to the books at my local library.
Bender, Well in that case. One planet down! Helmsman...
Hermes, What are ya-- Sacred hog of Prague! That was my anniversary gift to LaBarbara!
Amy," The usual  Boiling lead, oceans of lava."
Hermes, I've smoked a lot of paperwork in my day.
Hermes," Yeah, the Professor!"
Fry, What's your problem?
Bender, Then knock yourself out. Hey! Hey! Only eat and drink enough to barely keep yourselves alive! I'm trying to make a profit here.
Farnsworth, Leonardo! You're alive? Here?
Bender," If it's any consolation, my life is great! Babes! Bucks! I got it all!"
Zoidberg," Oh, you know!"
Hermes, No!
Leela, The tracks lead here.
Fry," He was a good man, Leela."
Fry, Uh yup! Just two robots out roboting it up! Eh?
Bender, I'm saying I've got an unbendable girder to bend.
Leela, You don't have to do that. I'm still seduced from before.
Farnsworth, Puff! What else you ladies got?
Fry, And great lift!
Zoidberg," Damnit, Fry! He may have done wrong, but he's still your captain."
Fry," Oh, sure."
Fry," Dearly beloved, we are here today to remember Bender, taken from us in the prime of life when he was crushed by a runaway semi driven by the Incredible Hulk."
Leela, I never heard you mention that.
Fry," I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh."
Zoidberg," Uh-huh, uh-huh."
Zoidberg, Alright. Give me the knife.
Bender," Ladies, gentlemen, smoking heaps of machinery ... ... this is a song called My Broken Friend. (singing) People say my broken friend is useless, But I say his mind is free, There's lots of things my mangled robot friend could be,"
Fry," They're scared of our raw power. Oh, but if you want a job, I could beg everyone at the company where I work."
Fry, Tomorrow?
Leela, Something's wrong. We're two metric tons overweight.
Bender, I said you two don't dress trampy enough. I still got it!
Bender," Oh, you're just gettin' to know Bender."
Fry, Mathematics of wanton burrito meals. I'll be there!
Bender, My body's 40% titanium! I'm finally richer than those snooty ATM machines.
Leela, I'm trying.
Fry, So? What do you think of my comic?
Bender," OK, we won't eat you."
Hermes," Are you back to your original age, Professor?"
Zoidberg, Congratulations.
Fry, Sorry.
Amy," If I had ever heard of it, it would have been what I had always dreamed of."
Zoidberg, I'll handle this!
Farnsworth," Eh, something about poison. Got it. Eh, by the way, that surgeon... Where is he?"
Bender," Ah, there. Finished. And with only six missing pieces!"
Bender," But I'm Bender, king of the combination shot. I put you in so that by busting you out, I could commit 15 felonies at once. Puttin' my rap sheet miles ahead of yours on the all-time chart."
Bender," A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we can always build more Killbots!"
Leela," Wow, look at that  Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the solar system."
Bender, I'm great! Everybody else sucks! Except that guy Bender. He's really somethin'!
Fry, Then I have no choice but to do something so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm ashamed to tell you about it.
Fry," Coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee!"
Bender, Randy?! 'Ave you been hangin' out with Randy?!
Fry, Leela?
Bender," What could have caused the leak? Excessive heat, on the count that I'm so hot?"
Fry," Yes! Here I come, future! Oh, no! Wait! I'm gonna get trapped in the Infosphere again! Just remember that Scooty-Puff Jr. sucks."
Bender," Alright, alright! If it means that much to you, blow up my statue."
Bender, The planet's covered with 'em.
Leela, I'll call him Nibbler.
Fry, What is it?
Zoidberg," Is ""desire to mate"" a feeling?"
Fry," Oh. In that case, 50 million."
Bender, 'Ello! What's all this then?
Hermes, The green dude and the fat man.
Fry, Shh! Nobody correct him!
Fry, Flexo! Shoot Flexo!
Fry," Bender, I really hope that's you. 'Cause if it isn't ... we're in trouble!"
Fry, Then ... then ... it was you!
Fry," Of course I do! Bigfoot's my hero. Growing up, he was the celebrity I most identified with."
Farnsworth," Well, that was an utter waste of time."
Fry, Bigfoot? Bigfoot?
Bender," I gotta say I'm really enjoying the day out with you people. Hey, a suicide booth! So long, suckers."
Bender," Santa's right. We need some sort of robot. Aw, crap! I'm some sort of robot."
Hermes," Just be back by sundown, mon."
Leela," Professor, why are you so hot and dusty over this dark matter shortage?"
Fry, Poor Bender. Without his brain he's become all quiet and helpful. We've got to go to the Central Bureaucracy and get that disk back!
Leela, The magician?
Fry," Hey, Leela, look at me!"
Fry, Yeah I'm a little confused too. How do I ... y'know ... with the tail and all?
Hermes, What shklee's actually doing.
Amy," It'll be a couple hours. Oh, I'm gonna get sweat on my sweat-suit."
Bender," Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs."
Leela," Aww, she sounds sweet."
Fry, Agreed. Yeah! Crank up the radio!
Bender, Alright. So I let one measly Bender get away. How much harm can one infinitely self-reproducing Robot do?
Fry, What up?
Fry, I am trying. I've been taking lessons.
Fry, Nooo! I could fit if I didn't have these damn arms!
Bender, Ooh!
Fry, I hate that rodent!
Bender, What a dump!
Hermes, Take a seat. We'll begin the interview shortly.
Fry," What are we supposed to do for money? All I've got is my frequent taffy eater's card, my first moustache ... ... and this picture of me and my old girlfriend, Michelle, and that ski instructor she was just friends with."
Fry, And your breezy short-shorts!
Fry, Look! Here's more!
Fry," Michelle, baby! Where you going?"
Farnsworth, Let's just hope we can sell enough of these calendars by tomorrow.
Amy," Fry... You're just upset because you drove Bender to suicide. Here, take your mind off it with these soothing relaxation balls."
Bender, Couple more of those and you'll have yourself a fish stick!
Amy, Could it've been flavour-blasted?
Amy," It's OK, I had fun. And if I ever feel lonely I can just look over at this disfiguring scar and think of you."
Amy," Poor, nasty, mean, old Bender. I can't believe we'll never hear his evil laugh again."
Bender," Where am I? I was exploring a wormhole through space many light years from this restaurant, when suddenly I was surrounded by darkness. (To Fanny ) Hot, sexy darkness. Oh, why, hello, Donbot! Hello, miss, have we met? I'm Bender. The world's most sexual robot. I mean, the world's most boundary-respecting robot."
Leela," These conditions are deplorable. I swear, I hate every single person on the surface for making us live like this."
Bender, Yay! Shankman!
Fry, You and me?
Leela, Really? How long was I out?
Leela, Yes.  I believe you.
Bender," That's ridiculous. There's no such thing as a ""freeze ray."" What, you mean a cone of coldness?"
Hermes, This thing always seems to know when I get the munchies! Attention followers  It's Free Topping Day at the pizza place across the street! Send.
Amy," Well, it's not me!"
Bender, What's that? Is someone bending girders?
Leela, Nibbler made a bo-bo.
Leela, That's perfect! We can reintroduce it to the wild and repopulate the species!
Leela, That's not true.
Hermes, Fight the power!
Hermes, Stop talking like that! You live on the Moon!
Bender," Aw, yeah. Bender! Bender! Bender!"
Amy, The doctor said you'd never wake up.
Leela, What does it say?
Fry," OK then, screw it."
Leela, I don't quite understand what this petition's about.
Leela," And what am I up to, you ask? Why, I'm a very successful space captain."
Bender, But isn't Mr. Wong building the 18th hole here? And the golf pants museum?
Fry, Leela!
Fry," Aw. Don't cry, foreign people. I used to work in a pizzeria and as soon as I stop hallucinating and blasting puke, I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza, Earth style!"
Zoidberg, How was your day?
Leela," So, Amy, how can I phrase this delicately? Why did Kif dump you like a sack of yesterday's turds?"
Fry," Poke harder, damn it!"
Leela," Fry, that's offensive to our people. Isn't it?"
Leela," Look, he's just a nobody who doesn't want to be a delivery boy. I'd really rather not force it on him."
Leela, What did I do?
Amy," Oh, yeah!"
Fry, It worked perfectly!
Bender," What does it matter? I'll never be a Globetrotter. My life, and, by extension, everyone else's, is meaningless."
Leela," Hurry, Bender!"
Leela, It got ruined in the wash.
Bender, Well then lose some weight.
Amy," I'm sorry. 80,000?"
Bender, Reload.
Fry," Look, associates. I made a hammock from our clothing."
Hermes, Everybody loves Slim.
Farnsworth, Why don't you try protesting? Like those native Martians; always whining that people don't treat their ancestor's bones with respect.
Hermes, And striped biologist-taunters.
Fry, Shows what you know. Crispy doesn't even rhyme with risky. Help! I'm drowning!
Bender," I was born ready! Gimme the bell! Did you hear a noise? Final boarding call for flight 406, non-stop service to pain. Now boarding standby passengers--"
Bender," Rock that Frenchman, baby!"
Leela, Just a few ... more ... hundred ... thousand ... miles. There!
Fry," Stop! You're just goin' around in circles! Think, Fry, think! Everyone's depending on you."
Zoidberg," Pulse, 300; liver, failing; cholesterol, 40?"
Hermes," Whatever you say, mon."
Leela, That's only four minutes from now.
Fry, What?
Leela," Thanks, Linda. Now we're in here because we tried to save endangered wildlife. So this time, endangered wildlife will save us."
Leela, Do what I say. Tell her!
Hermes, I thought you were named Angus.
Leela, I've got a better plan.
Bender," So, Leela, you must have had your pick of the litter last night at closing time."
Leela, One!
Hermes," Better! The Central Bureaucracy is conducting an inspection tomorrow. I will finally be promoted to grade 35, the 35th highest grade there is."
Hermes," Sing me home! When push comes to shove, You gotta do what you love, Even if it's not a good idea!"
Bender," Ah, good. I often have thoughts and feelings that can only be expressed through dance. You stink. Bender's great. Deal with it."
Bender," Uh, look, Planet Express Ship, this might not be the best time, but, well, I really like you and whatever, but, I think we should just be friends."
Farnsworth," The odour of pure time leaking. When my crew removed the Chronitons, it destabilised the nebula, causing time skips throughout the universe."
Leela, This is where we distinguish ourselves from the last crew. Activate emergency high-speed self-contained escape pack crisis response unit. Quick!
Leela, Hands up! Tentacles too!
Leela, You've got to tell her the truth. And lay off the salted peanuts!
Fry, Mind if we sit with you?
Fry, That's it! I'm gonna deliver a gift of my boot up Santa's chimney. Where is he?
Farnsworth, Bull pies!
Leela," Oh, lord! Now what?"
Zoidberg," Relax, Fry. I'm a doctor. I'm sure the robut will be just fine with a little help."
Fry, Bender! Are you OK?
Leela, What little there is to be had.
Leela," Wait, you're making a-- Ooh! Look at that. I feel like a princess!"
Bender, Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake pizza delivery.
Bender," Of course. I'm a bender, I went to Bending College. I majored in Bending."
Fry," Whoa! They discovered an intact, 20th century pizzeria, just like the one I used to work at."
Bender," OK, OK, OK. Get ready for this part."
Fry, I feel better about myself!
Farnsworth, So that's what things would be like if I'd invented the fing-longer. A man can dream though. A man can dream.
Leela," No! I don't care how hilarious your apron is, we're not cooking him. Aww! I'll call him Nibbler."
Farnsworth," No, no! That was all just special effects! Now let's have breakfast. I hope everyone likes eggs."
Fry," Hey, Leela, get a picture of me being ""mugged""."
Fry, Looks like Bender learned an important lesson about respecting other people's feelings afterall.
Zoidberg," Well I have a lot of experience telling patients bad news, so let me break it to him gently. Fry, you have no nose! Your nose is gone! You have no nose on your face! Where it is I can't say but on your face it's not!"
Bender," Forget it, pal. It says on this bottle-cap you have to party with us."
Bender, Ow!
Farnsworth," It passed through unharmed. So living beings can enter the other universe, but electrical devices can't?"
Fry, I guess he realised I was right when I told him to go back to the jungle.
Fry," Ohh, ice cold."
Farnsworth," Oh, it's no use. Earth is dead. This is the end of all things."
Fry, Help!
Fry," I'm on it. But if you need me, you know where I'll be."
Bender," Shut up, Zoidberg! The robot bending events are starting. Something tells me I could easily beat those trained professionals. Wow! That guy must be like the world's greatest bender. My dreams of glory died before they began."
Fry, We were canceled?
Hermes," People, as you know, our young sons have become great successes in the very same field as us."
Fry, We sometimes called it a jogging suit.
Leela, Relax. The ship's not going anywhere. I anchored it with the unbreakable diamond tether.
Amy," You shut up! I love it, Kif. I'll use it whenever I wanna know what time it is. Ooh! It's Fry and Leela! Hi, Fry and Leela!"
Bender,"   Daisy, Daisy, Give me your answer do,"
Leela, Did you delete it?
Farnsworth, It's just my way of thanking you for not reporting my countless violations of safety and minimum wage laws.
Hermes, Where 'ave you blokes been? You nearly missed elevenses.
Bender," Come on, you wimp! Work that weasel! Quit holding out on us."
Fry, I'll just take that to go.
Farnsworth, Perhaps this movie will help us take our minds off the heat.
Bender," Nah, I'm not really in the--"
Bender," Yeah, like you don't have crap in your neck!"
Fry," Every time something good happens to me you say it's some kind of madness, or I'm drunk, or I ate too much candy. Well I saw a real mermaid and I wish for once my friends would have decency and kindness to believe me."
Leela," It's tempting, but, uh, I have a fiancé now. Uh, hmm, uh, hmm, uh, we--, uh ... Him! Fry, darling, meet Zapp Brannigan."
Bender," Normally, when a cop asks me that, I spray whipped cream in his eyes and run away. But, to ditch these losers, gladly."
Amy," A big, fat roach!"
Bender," I'm back, baby!"
Fry," Yeah, OK. What's the weather like?"
Leela," Thank you, Fry. I think maybe I can stomach that kiss now."
Fry, I'm talking about Flexo.
Fry," Wait a second. I'm getting an idea. N-No, false alarm. No. Yeah. No. Yeah. No. Wait. No. Yeah. Yeah. No ... no. Yes!"
Leela," Well, there isn't any dark matter. Nibbler hasn't pooped at all. And he ate a whole family of koalas last night. Nibbler! Nibbler!"
Leela," Fry, remember when I told you about always ending your stories a sentence earlier?"
Leela," OK, Fnog, that's enough. Call him off. Fnog? Hmm."
Leela, Could you get the lights on your way out?
Bender, Boo-hoo.
Zoidberg, No. This is one death Dr. Zoidberg won't be responsible for. Zoidberg away!
Leela, OK. Eye off the ball.
Bender," Hey, hot stuff."
Bender, I don't know. I only gamble with chumps.
Leela, Threaten all you-- Wait. What?
Fry," I knew it! Insane theories, one; regular theories, a billion."
Bender, The Mighty V-GINY!
Fry," Leela, I've got an idea. Stay here with Queequeg."
Bender, Yeah? Well assist this!
Fry," Goodbye, friends. I never thought I would die like this. But I'd always really hoped."
Fry, But— But Randy said—
Amy, Yeah!
Bender," Fat chance! You can't count on God for jack. He pretty much told me so himself. Now come on. If we don't save those monks, no one will!"
Leela, I did it! I blunk!
Bender," Sorry. Well, that solves the mystery of the missing ring. This calls for a drink."
Bender, Told you!
Fry, Ow!
Bender, Uh-huh!
Fry, The cat! Is it alive or dead? Alive or dead?!
Farnsworth," That you for your sympathy, talking square of linoleum."
Farnsworth," Zoidberg, you are the greatest hero. You saved us all."
Bender," Sure, but who's going to do anything about it? Certainly not us. No, sir!"
Bender, That's just what my mom used to tell me.
Fry,   I am fully operational Captain.
Fry," Boring? Baseball wasn't - hmm, so they finally jazzed it up?"
Leela, Good for you. Now lets all get back to the ship.
Fry," Way to overact ,Zoidberg!"
Bender," It sure is. By the way, I saved your stuff."
Amy, Duh!
Fry, But I've never written an opera.
Leela, Forty kilometers. Fifty!
Bender," Uh, no! That's not necessary, really! I think I hear my factory recalling me. Oh! That's what I get for sharing my vulnerability with you."
Bender, I do.
Bender, Alright! Closure!
Zoidberg," How are you doing there, Fry? Glad to hear it. Aha!"
Bender," Hey, bite my shiny metal ass!"
Amy," Well, with Zapp gone and my parents still here, I suggest Fry give me a nice, convincing kiss."
Bender, Come on! Surely there must be someone here who knows how great I was.
Amy," It's OK, Kif. I'll go get you a tissue from your tote."
Leela, It's not the year 4000.
Bender," ""Bender's Arrest Record"" by the police. On March 3rd at 2pm, Bender was caught shoplifting."
Bender," Sweet photons. I don't know if you're waves or particles, but you go down smooth."
Amy, Yeah.
Leela," No, I mean cool your jets. They're melting Bender's face."
Fry, I can't believe Leela and Amy aren't back yet from their half-date. I'm gonna call the restaurant.
Fry," Yeah, be more impulsive. Like this."
Farnsworth," Yes, damnit!"
Fry, My God! A million years!
Bender, Pffft!  What a load of mush!  I've had it!
Bender, No! Don't come in!
Zoidberg, Is it possible that all this slavery and oppression is shmutzing up our freedom lesson?
Farnsworth," Well, at least we have each other, so it truly is the worst Xmas ever."
Fry, Uh--
Leela," Well, this is the big moment. It's finally time to take my eye patch off."
Zoidberg," Clothing, delicious clothing!"
Bender, Yeah!
Fry," Don't know, Bender. Tonight's my big date with Colleen. I got to run."
Farnsworth," Hubert Farnsworth, at your service."
Leela, Then why should I trust you? Why?
Fry," Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own body back."
Amy, Scary Door!
Farnsworth," Well, this is it, old friends. Planet Express is done for, what with our delivery crew missing and the abysmal sales of Tickle Me Bender."
Hermes, You have to learn to work together again.
Hermes, The Federal Sex Bureau.
Fry," Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender, he's the best ... ... at being a big jerk who's stupid and his big, ugly face is as dumb as a butt."
Hermes, I beg to differ!
Leela, What's that supposed to mean?
Fry, Hmm? Mmm!
Leela, You don't mean that!
Amy, Zoidberg had hair?!
Bender," Yep, that's what her donor card says."
Amy," Hmm, I'll pick!"
Fry, Quick! This way!
Farnsworth," No. Actually we've discovered that Fry's dog was fast-fossilised, preserving it's cellular structure!"
Bender," Aw, crap! The cops!"
Fry, I didn't? Damn.
Amy," Oh, no! Could the seed have been contaminated by a virus from the germ vault?"
Fry, And no one will have to punish anyone for the mutiny.
Bender," Go, man! Go!"
Bender, Wait a second. Here comes Leela.
Bender, Ah-ah-ah! What do we say when someone gives you something?
Farnsworth," Impending news, everyone!  We're about to learn the winner of the bet!"
Fry, What happens to the loser?
Bender, Your weiner!
Farnsworth," Eh, wha?"
Leela," Y'know, why don't we talk about something besides Zapp for a while?"
Farnsworth, Tate? What do you know about this?
Fry, That's all.
Bender, Huh?
Bender," Button your yap, you mug!"
Bender, I was having the most wonderful dream. I think you were in it.
Bender, Ah!
Fry, At least I have friends on the outside. Bender's been no help at all.
Fry, We're gonna crash!
Bender, The only reason you get all the guys is because you dress like a tramp!
Bender," Well, I'm off to work at the restaurant. One of you will have to fill in for me while I'm gone."
Bender," It's so good. Oh, just try a little!"
Fry," Oh, that. Maybe we'd better talk in private. I'll meet you in the closet."
Leela, Mom? Dad? I showed up! And I got the audio tour for Treasures of Liberace's Tomb.
Farnsworth, There's the door.
Bender," Je suis Napoleon! No, seriously, I'm not."
Hermes," Finally, the last form of the day. Welcome to Stampy Town. Population, five! And now for the finishing touch. Ah, the cycle of bureaucracy. Sweet gorilla of Manila! A letter from the Central Bureaucracy! Attention, Hermes Conrad  You are about to receive a letter from the Central Bureaucracy. My God! It's from the Central Bureaucracy!"
Farnsworth," Good news, Mom. I've invented a new children's toy. I call it ""Q.T. McWhiskers"". When you pet it, it shoots rainbows from its eyes."
Leela, Psst. Are you alone?
Fry," Uh, I'll have a coffee."
Leela, Um ... a grey-ish blob?
Farnsworth, Keep trying.
Amy," Somebody do something! Here, take this."
Fry, Of course! It's so simple!
Bender," Damn, you're cute."
Fry, We made it! I'm at a Hollywood party!
Leela, Where are we?
Bender, Ooh! Look! It's the Centaur race.
Fry," Yo, hook me up. My turkey is dry and I've tried everything. Oh, right. Never mind."
Farnsworth," I hate these nerds. Just because I'm stupider than them, they think they're smarter than me. Kill them all, starting with the math teacher!"
Bender," What? That's it? Who are you? You're nobody! This is the worst funeral ever! I hope you're all happy. You've succeeded in convincing me life is worth living, by showing how bad my funeral will suck."
Bender, String 'im up!
Fry," Oh, that's just some relish from a hot dog I found."
Amy, What was the bear's name?
Bender, Not kosher! It has to be petroleum oil! Do you not give a damn about the hallowed traditions of Robanukah?!
Fry, Then let the video games begin! Wait. Hang on. I— I lost my controller.
Zoidberg," Captain Brannigan, you're always welcome here at Rancho Zoidberg!"
Leela, Why would Fry be immune to the flying brains? Because he doesn't shower?
Fry, I guess so. Watch the neck! Watch the neck!
Hermes, It's alright. This place just needs a one-hour bureaucratizing.
Bender, We thought you only cared about cans of anchovies and stuffy old songs about the buttocks.
Fry, Who would do a thing like that?
Leela," This is sub-commander L., with a message for Leo Wong. Leo, you're a parasite on the universe, and parasites must be destroyed. That's why we've adopted this parasite as our mascot. I know it's a little confusing. The point is, even this vicious leech has a right to exist. And that's why a vicious leech like Leo Wong must be exterminated. Again, confusing. Feministas unite!"
Bender, Mine!
Fry, Not big enough. We need something that can take out an entire army. Something you could commit a war crime with--
Fry, Shall we say eight o'clock?
Bender," Son, you in a whole mess of trouble."
Fry," So, Leela, were you able to help the penguins?"
Fry," Oh, yeah!"
Leela," Boy, that thing's big. Fry, is my colossal eye too big?"
Hermes," Well, see you in an hour. I gotta go do some business behind that tree."
Fry, I'll show you. Whup.
Fry," I did ... I think. It was probably about 50/50. But that's how I really felt about you, I swear!"
Bender," Ah, save it for the cross-burning, Adolf!"
Farnsworth," Incredible! According to the gizmometer, Fry touched the royal jelly in the space hive, leaving an imprint of his DNA and brainwaves. Then, when it spilled on the couch, it recombined with trace amounts of Fry's hair and skin--"
Leela, Leela. Amy?
Leela," It'll take more than deadly, deadly bees to keep us from doing our job. Come on, boys."
Bender, Ugh. You are the worst kind of rich person.
Fry," Come on, Leela. You can do it!"
Farnsworth," Eh, now, now. Let's not all panic at once. We'll have to take shifts. Hermes, you'll take the first six hours."
Leela," OK, just try to be nonchalant."
Farnsworth, Good news! There's a report on TV with some very bad news.
Farnsworth, I'm sorry what?
Farnsworth," Good news, anyone. The Swedish robot from Pi-kea is here with the super collider I ordered."
Zoidberg, Fellows! Fellows! How about a film we can all enjoy? Planet Of The Clams. It's about an upside-down world where lobster is slave to clam.
Fry," Well, I spent every penny I had but I bet Leela's gonna love you. Hey, you're quite the talker, aren't you? Shut the hell up! Ow! Stupid bird! I know where you live."
Leela, But how did you know we were here?
Farnsworth," Hear, hear! Now let's all of us shut up and sing!"
Fry, The car dealer? Wow! I guess his prices really were insane.
Farnsworth," Oh, don't worry, Fry. I too once spent a nightmare-ish time in a robot asylum. But now it's nearly over. So long."
Bender, We both know I won't do that! Either you're gonna shoot me or I'm gonna spray whipped cream in your eyes and walk outta here like a big shot.
Leela," Nonsense, the evening's young. So, Gary, what do you do for a living?"
Zoidberg, Good riddance.
Bender, Next!
Leela, Odour at magnitude 8. Magnitude 12. Magnitude 31. We're breaking up. Turn on the anti-smell device.
Bender, Just ask Flabby over here to describe it to you later.
Bender, It's over! My dream of being a chef is deader than the cat I'm sitting on!
Bender," I said ""words""."
Fry," Hey, I wonder if these guys are here to watch the erotic display too."
Bender," Well, we're boned!"
Bender, Stinking bureaucrats! I hate 'em.
Leela," Nibbler, I don't think we're in New New York anymore. Jeez! Apparently the phrase ""tone it down"" doesn't exist on this planet. Oh, no! We hit someone! Quick, back into the ship. Ooh! Nice boots!"
Fry," We checked 90,000 cans of Slurm and all we won was this junk. I never wanna see another can of Slurm again. Man, am I thirsty."
Bender, You're one to talk!
Amy," Yes, it's, it's-- No! I can't do this!"
Bender," I've grown far beyond the petty concerns of your world. Every time I burp, a new galaxy is born. Two if I've been eatin' broccoli. All existence is just a chess game. An' I can see fifty moves ahead. Human emotion no longer concerns me."
Leela, Sure. I'm having a great time -- really. You two go enjoy yourselves.
Fry, Maybe that planet over there has a drive-thru. A Burger Jerk or a Fishy Joe's or a Chizzler or something.
Fry, Stand back and watch the master! This Slurm can. Now it's garbage. These papers. Garbage. This picture of your wife. Pure garbage. Now you try it.
Zoidberg, Looks like you're retaining water.
Leela, What is it? We'll do anything.
Leela," Why, Major McZongo? Why?"
Leela, Okay! That's it! I need some air.
Leela," Alright, can we try not to complicate this?"
Bender," Yeah! Anyone who misses this will regret it the rest of his life. Hey, Fry, could you go make some popcorn?"
Bender, ...That robot's name I never told you...
Hermes," Professor, sprinkle us with wisdom from your mighty brain. How scared should we be?"
Fry," Oh, jeez! Better not let Leela see me."
Amy, You're going to Nigel 7? Kif's on patrol near there. You could drop me off on the way.
Bender," So, uh, what time d'you close tonight?"
Amy, Were they little grey dudes with big oval heads? I don't get that gesture. Am I wrong?
Leela," Yeah, sure."
Bender, You lived before you met me?
Fry, Quit complaining! My body rejected your liver and now I've got Garfield syndrome. I hate Mondays.
Leela, But I've got a no-hitter going. You're right. Here.
Farnsworth," Ah, here they come."
Bender, Wait a second. Did you rip off your own arm as a joke?
Leela, I didn't know you could take this thing off.
Fry, What turned them to stone?
Fry," No! That's my dog in there. It's an outrage, I say! I'm taking him home and I'd like to see anyone try and stop me. Uh-oh!"
Farnsworth, Make up with her? After she went all psycho when I thought everything was cool? Impossible!
Leela," Fry, untie us, quick!"
Leela," Fine, Mr. Know-It-All-About-Something-Finally, you tell a story!"
Farnsworth, I'm just glad I have my wool scarf.
Zoidberg, My God! da Vinci left his legs unpainted as a clue.
Fry, Run!
Fry, I want you to wake up.
Leela," Outta my way, shrimp-oh. We're here to bring Santa back so we can prove Bender's innocent."
Bender, Leela who?!
Amy, Hooray!
Farnsworth," Eh, wha?"
Leela," You're in tremendous danger, you idiot! Half of these Emperors were drunk at their own coronation."
Bender, Thou shalt not snatch.
Hermes, So... Tell us. How's the intergalactic real estate going?
Zoidberg, Leela. Me saving things the leech. Not the eating of it.
Fry, They're OK.
Bender, Better than usual!
Fry, We'll show him who's stupid.
Hermes, Look at that  The carts go out full but they come in empty. It's criminally inefficient.
Bender, This is great! My buddy's alive and his credit cards are valid again. Let's go get hammered!
Bender," Nope, pubic library."
Farnsworth," Eh, Francis, I have good news. It's time for your first delivery... To the Moon!"
Fry, Don't point that at me.
Amy, Mister? Could you please get those keys out for me?
Amy," Oh, no! They have her totally outnumbered."
Fry," Not physically. But why don't you ask your new best friend, Leela?"
Leela, Time's up. Make a U-turn at the next crater.
Leela," Oh, no! Quick! Get them into the fountain!"
Hermes," Tell me, Zoidberg  Is it carapace or carapass?"
Bender," Are you hurt, my sweet?"
Farnsworth," Well, it doesn't look like I'll make it inside with the rest of you. Uh, but good luck. Just leave me where I drop."
Amy, What's his problem?
Farnsworth, You what? After I spent months slaving over a hot monkey brain?
Fry, Kind of.
Bender," Come look, everyone. I just got the dearest presents for Mommy."
Fry, Well just let me know if there's anything I can do to make it up to you.
Hermes," What difference does it make?  When that death sphere gets to Earth, we'll all be blown to Manwich meat!"
Fry," Girly calendar? Great idea, Amy!"
Fry," You don't have to explain, Leela. You're you. That's all I need to know."
Bender, Now they drank my booze?! They've gone too far!
Leela," So why are these Brain Spawn attacking Earth, Nibbler?"
Hermes, I don't care. I just need it long enough to bird dog in an win LaBarbara back.
Bender, I don't even breathe oxygen!
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! I was up all night inventing, and then finally, I invented!"
Fry, The corner! Why didn't I think of that?
Leela, We've had it with Zoidberg! We demand you fire him!
Bender," Hey, Mac, where do you want those rat droppings you ordered?"
Fry, At least it's something to distract me from Leela. Nah. Now that I like for some reason.
Fry," Well, once in the park."
Fry, That wasn't a little extra weight.
Leela, It's up to us to rescue him.
Bender, Ah! Nothing like a warm fire and a Super Soaker of fine cognac.
Bender, But?
Leela, Well ... which of you wrote me that sonnet?
Farnsworth, Huh-woh?
Bender," You do? Look, are you going to help or not?"
Fry, Let's just hope the experiment's still in here. Yes! We're saved!
Leela," Wait. If you killed your grandfather, why do you still exist?"
Fry, A successor?
Zoidberg," Packed and ready, sir."
Fry," No, no, I think I'll just smell around a bit over here! Hmm. Hmm."
Fry, The tongue tickles.
Hermes, Dear Eliza!
Bender," That robot has a tragic secret, That I'd like to share..."
Hermes, I don't care in the slightest.
Fry," No, you brought us here."
Farnsworth, No. Why would I know that?
Farnsworth, Though it did get me some action!
Leela," The old comedians were right, this place is a lot different from L.A."
Bender, Here.
Leela, What's the mission?
Bender," Yeah, what's the deal? Just when I thought I'd figured out you biological creatures, it's something else! Lemme at 'im! Come over here, Kif! You--"
Fry, Are there really giant birds like that?
Farnsworth," Yes, easily."
Fry, Never bet against me being stupid.
Bender, Now what?
Fry, You mean--
Bender," Guys, guys! I taught myself to knit."
Leela," Hello, Zapp?"
Fry," Nowadays, people aren't interested in art that's not tattooed on fat guys."
Fry, I know. I was deliberately describing a similar situation.
Fry," 80,000 years?"
Farnsworth," If you can't see well enough through the two-way mirror, there'll be a close-up on this video screen."
Hermes," No, from the bottom ! It works better!"
Leela," OK, we're here!"
Fry," Mmmm, at least hot dogs haven't changed."
Bender, What?
Fry, I don't know why my brother hated me so much.
Farnsworth," Wait! Before my moment of shame, can I..."
Fry, Leave me alone.
Farnsworth," What the-- Did everything just jump around, or did my brain just stroke off there for a second?"
Fry, I'm gonna grab another beer.
Leela, I said we'll go to the jungle and let Guenter decide once and for all.
Bender, Lady and gentleman! How 'bout a hand for my temporary replacement assistant?
Hermes," Okay, then. Men, let's get hunting. The women folk can cook what we catch."
Hermes, I'll just have a Shirley Hemple.
Bender, Tempers are wearing thin. Let's just hope some robot doesn't kill everybody.
Bender," You want me to concludify him, like some sort of dispatcherator?"
Bender, It is!
Zoidberg," Excellent, excellent!"
Fry," In your face, Leela."
Fry, Pah! I'd have won a lot of money too if I still had my lucky seven-leaf clover. Plus I'd still have my hair.
Amy, I'll say.
Fry," Love the tentacle, honey."
Farnsworth," Yes, Bender, thank you. In short, the various fluids Fry left in the couch caused the royal jelly to regenerate his entire being."
Leela, You can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.
Leela, Has anyone seen Fry's ass? It's late for a date with my boot.
Fry, Got it.
Leela," Dr. Zoidberg, can I talk to you about Fry?"
Leela," I'm Leela. Now, it's New Year's Eve so I'd like to decide your fate quickly and get out of here."
Leela, Thanks for coming out to get to know my boyfriend. Isn't he dreamy?
Zoidberg, They said I probably shouldn't be a surgeon.
Fry, That's what I'm trying to tell you. See-- Why are you all staring at me like that? Is there something on my face?
Amy, You're having an affair with the head of the robot mafia's wife?
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. Tomorrow you'll be making a delivery to Ebola 9, the virus planet."
Hermes, Your manwich!
Fry, Oh right. I wonder where they all smoke in high school.
Leela, Anytime. I actually enjoyed hanging out with you.
Amy, Cute name.
Fry, I dunno. Maybe God loves me.
Zoidberg," So, what's with all the screaming?"
Bender," It ain't easy. It just proves how great I am. Ohhh, Fry, I'd give anything to unmurder you!"
Fry," But-but, you didn't even look at your cards!"
Bender," No, wait, three. I stepped on a leprechaun."
Bender," Give us a name, MacButt!"
Fry," Uh, OK. Oh, man!"
Zoidberg," Ah, fame. Where do I come in?"
Farnsworth," Of course it wanted a saucer, you idiot. A saucer of dewicious cweam."
Farnsworth," But Guenter's obviously better off being intelligent. Tell him, Leela."
Fry," Hey, Bender. Sounds like you could use a little of that oil."
Amy, This chair is so comfortable.
Bender, Stupid jerks wouldn't let me stay in the good future.
Bender," Stop thinking, Fry!"
Leela," No, he didn't."
Farnsworth, The beast aproacheth.
Farnsworth," Hmm. Perhaps the computer can calculate its trajectory. My God! Whatever it is, it's headed straight for us. With enough force to reduce this entire city to a stinky crater. We have less than 72 hours."
Bender, A baby what? Ow!
Hermes, Sweet tornadoes of Barbados! Bender and Amy have been torn to shreds!
Leela, There. Today's story is from New Teen magazine. What would you rather hear about? Four-legged Chachi or tentacled Chachi?
Leela," Huh. So, apparently, Major McZongo and Mr. Peppy were each doing about half the sheep killing."
Leela, Leela bring fire?
Farnsworth," I know my new plan is a long shot, but it's the only hope left."
Amy," They're not your parents, I'm not your sister and that's not your golf cart."
Bender," That painting, the eyes are watching me!"
Fry," Oh, nothing."
Farnsworth, It must be mating season for Zoidberg's people; a chaotic time when his behaviour is dictated by the tiny brain in his rump.
Zoidberg," I know you are, but what am I?"
Amy, Quit exaggerating.
Bender," Listen, Ship! No one changes my stations! I hope you have a good mechanic!"
Bender, He wasn't and he didn't!
Amy," Look, we're not as rich as everybody says."
Fry, What the hell is that?
Fry, Really?
Fry," Yes, you do! You came back in time to knock me into that freezer and now I came back in time to stop you."
Fry, Get outta here! What's Andy up to these days?
Zoidberg," Oh, God! I'm coming down!"
Bender, El zilcho? Is it too late to change my superhero name?
Bender," Don't worry, Kif. I'm sure some other beautiful, rich girl will fall in love with you."
Leela, Too much papers! Not enough hiding plants!
Zoidberg," What's that loud, boring sound you'll hear when I stop talking?"
Bender," Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg here is desperately poor and miserably lonely? Puh-lease!"
Bender," Is it valuable? Could it be taken from you if you were, say... Unconscious?"
Fry, Uh ... what?
Fry, I'm so lonely since I came to the future. Will you be my friend? Ow! Who are you?
Fry, I don't know. Is it really you?
Fry," Hey, yeah!"
Leela, Aha!
Leela, Lars says I'm dreamy.
Bender, What? Wither?
Farnsworth, Onto the Internet you go!
Hermes, Happy Freedom Day! Ooh! I think my wrist is broken.
Leela, Thank God most of our fans are huge perverts!
Hermes," The League of Robots doesn't exist, tin mon. It's just a cartoon for babies."
Zoidberg, Urgh!
Farnsworth," Hang on, I just want to make one stop."
Leela," We have to walk like robots, talk like robots and if necessary solve complex differential equations like robots."
Hermes, Wha?
Fry," I'm sorry you had to give up being a kid, Leela."
Bender, A diamond vial of Mrs. Dash?
Leela, Hey!
Bender," No, I sold my body."
Amy," He's not scrawny, he's just small-boned."
Bender," I got 48 cents. There's one more nickel, and it's a big one!"
Bender, And now to present the award for Best Actor ... ... a bit player in the flop movie The Magnificent Three ... ... Dr. Zoidberg.
Fry, What's that?
Farnsworth, You're not through with this level! I have another lens.
Zoidberg, But you won this Golden Globe!
Farnsworth," Well, I've got to go take this suit to the decontaminators. You two lock up the F-ray and for the love of God don't let it fall into the wrong hands."
Fry, Who said that? Hey! What the--? Ooh! Ow! Ow!
Zoidberg, Lucky you. All I have is a gland that gives off foul odors when I'm bored.
Leela, Could one of you guys get that?
Bender, Coming!
Bender," Oh, I see. A bunch of stuff gets bent so it must be the robot designed for bending."
Fry, The machines. They're after me!
Bender, What's happening? Just in time!
Farnsworth, Not distant enough! I'll be a monkey's uncle if I'm this monkey's nephew!
Fry," You could've have picked a better time to dump the ship, Bender!"
Hermes," Professor, it's 4 00."
Amy," Bender, wasn't that Fry's tent?"
Bender, Im pending para un bending!
Bender," Got it. Large kickle, hold the tickle!"
Fry, I can see I have no future here. My only option is to resign with dignity. Here are my shorts.
Fry," Goodbye, Leela. Hey, look, we're under the mistletoe."
Leela," We'd love to have you on the team, Bender. But aren't you more on the supply side of crime?"
Farnsworth," No, Leela! You can't give up your childhood! You'll never have another chance at it!"
Leela, That doesn't prove I killed him.
Fry, Send
Leela," Not if I can help it! Oh, I guess I can't. Everyone, put on your seatbelts."
Farnsworth," Behold! The Svalbard Global Seed Vault! Since 2008, the vault has preserved seeds of every known plant species in case of extinction."
Fry," At, uh, uh, a concert."
Fry, 20 minutes? You're practically ready now!
Fry," Yeah, I was going to thumb through that later."
Amy," Bender, are you jealous of Fry's puppy? That's so adorable!"
Leela," No, not anymore. I wanna stay here and become the new Wicked Witch."
Fry, I am at ease.
Farnsworth, I designed it myself. Let me show you some of the different lengths of wire I used.
Farnsworth," Ladies, here are your demeaning, skimpy stewardess outfits."
Leela, Of course.
Leela," Look, the Professor trusts me with a giant spaceship. He wouldn't trust the rest of you with his dentures."
Hermes, Lower.
Bender, Ooh! That's a-comfy!
Farnsworth," Good Lord, Bubblegum. The duplicate body is emitting doom at ten times the back ground level."
Fry, No way! We've got so much in common.
Leela," Uh, do you think you could be just little less evil than that."
Fry, I dunno. But someday we'll find out. Won't we?
Fry, Hurry! We've gotta think of another way to save Bender or Xmas will be ruined!
Fry, But your parents are gross sewer mutants.
Leela, Does that mean they only do 60% of the work you do or that they actually do more work because they're only 60% as lazy?
Leela, Wait. Our pet Nibbler loves fresh crocodile. It's his favourite treat. He must be El Chupanibre.
Zoidberg, And that's that.
Zoidberg, Beautiful kids. You must be very proud!
Fry," Wait! If they mean that much to you, why do you wanna kill them?"
Amy, Why did their voices change?
Farnsworth," Eh, wha?"
Bender," Oh! Thank God. Tell me, have things changed on the outside. Is food finally in pill form? What about pills? Are they in food form?"
Bender," I said, ""Do it!"""
Amy," Ooh! It's a party, apparently."
Hermes, His name is Helper and he's eager to be your new best friend.
Farnsworth," Won't you join us, Mr. Blob?"
Farnsworth, Can I give my boy a hug?
Farnsworth," Urectum. Here, let me locate it for you."
Fry, He's gonna blow!
Fry," Professor, you're a professor. You must have some ideas."
Fry," Well, Rudy, how do you like this action?"
Leela, Hurry!
Fry, Not if you don't freeze me.
Bender," Hmm. Get him, boys!"
Leela, But the movie--
Hermes," He must've gone out looking for that mermaid. The poor, demented honky."
Amy, The sky out here is amazing. Look at all those satellites.
Zoidberg," Alright, alright. Let me have one of your young on a roll."
Bender, We're back for our time machine.
Leela," You go, gorilla !"
Zoidberg," No, don't hurt him! He's my best friend!"
Bender, In here is the only place I'm not. I amuse myself.
Amy," Yeah, that's really great. Could you please tell us what's going on?"
Leela," Eh, it's fine."
Hermes," No! This is impossible! Quit blacking out and look at this. Inspectors 1, 2, 3, 4... 6. There's no trace of Inspector 5!"
Fry, No. It would just go in one ear and out some other hole.
Bender," Aw, what crazy thing am I going to date next?"
Bender," Hey, I called this city! Quit touching my stuff!"
Amy," Plus, you don't really have the thighs for a miniskirt."
Farnsworth," This $4 coffee pot talks about love, but what he describes is perversion."
Bender," I'll miss you, meatbag."
Zoidberg," I can't, I'm still eating. Help me, Leela."
Leela, Bender?
Bender," Oh, cruel fate, I'm dead. They're putting me in my Sunday suit and shoving me in a wooden box. Now they're loading me into cold, cold ground. Hello! Here come the worms!"
Fry," Oh, great. What do we got? Wall gophers? Toilet snails?"
Fry, Leela?!
Farnsworth," The neck protector, the neck protector junior, and now, for a limited time, the lady neck protector!"
Fry, That's not soon enough.
Bender, $100 a week?
Bender," But, Mr. Mayor, that doesn't sound humane."
Fry, No!
Hermes, Never!
Farnsworth," Oh, perhaps I've been too harsh. Come, lad, take my hand and I'll explain why I find you so repugnant."
Fry, History.
Leela," The thing is, Fry is very sweet, but he's so immature. I love his boyish charm but I hate his childishness."
Leela," Look, Bender! It's Patch Cord Adams. He heals with the power of laughter."
Bender," Oh, no! I forgot this is a hoverbridge."
Fry, Are you familiar with this particular location?
Bender, Joey! Clamps! Donny B!
Fry, So what were they doing to you in that awful drawer?
Fry," Valentine's Day's coming? Oh, crap! I forgot to get a girlfriend again. Well, since neither of us has a date, why don't we...?"
Leela, What for?
Amy, You're impossible.
Bender," Superking has no need for loved ones. How ya doin', kid?"
Zoidberg," In my experience, boxes are usually empty. Or maybe with a little cheese stuck to the top. And one time pepperoni! What a day that was! Give me the box!"
Farnsworth, Really? I guess when you're around it all day you stop noticing. Off you go.
Leela, We're not at the any place! And we're out of fuel!
Zoidberg, Alright!
Fry, Oh.
Leela," That's a stupid question. What matters is Zapp Brannigan is the sorriest captain I've ever seen, and I saw the idiot blow up DOOP headquarters with my own eye."
Leela, You mean I'd be the first woman ever to play Major League Blernsball?
Bender, I sure didn't.
Hermes, Soothe us with sweet lies.
Leela, We're out of options. We have to steal the Gemerald!
Hermes," No, we're not! We just go to limbo!"
Leela," Bender, why are you spending so much time in the bathroom? Are you jacking on in there?"
Leela, Stop him.
Hermes," Happy day, mon! It's good to have you back."
Amy, He's dead!
Bender, Can't ... I ... can't ... do ... it!
Bender, Let's get drunk!
Leela," Look, I don't know if shooting penguins will help the environment or not. But I do know the decision shouldn't be in the hands of people who just wanna kill for fun."
Bender," Look, we just came to party with Slurms MacKenzie. By the way, when is that scheduled?"
Leela," Fry, this is the stupidest, sweetest thing you've ever done. And you know, maybe now, together, we can be an inspiration to other mutants."
Leela, Can you believe the price of dark matter? It'd be cheaper to fill the tank with Nobel Prize winners' sperm.
Fry, I wouldn't wanna be me right now.
Farnsworth, I can wire anything directly into anything. I'm the professor!
Bender," I've been perusing your fortified wine list and I've selected the '71 Hobo's Delight, the '57 Chateau Parté and the '66 Thunder Chevitz."
Bender, What? Me? I didn't do nothing. You're thinking of the kid.
Leela, Are you sure I have to sit in your lap?
Fry, What?
Bender, That wasn't love.
Leela, Dr. Zoidberg? Are you OK?
Bender, Bam!
Bender, Ooh! Dibs on his CD player!
Leela," Thanks so much for inviting us, Mr. Wong. I've never been to a Mars Day barbecue."
Fry, You do?
Farnsworth, Moron!
Leela, Then we'll need a guide. Someone who's been there before.
Zoidberg," That's all good fun. But, of course, a clamp is no substitute for the precision of a genuine—"
Leela," You're too late, Fry. I'm sharing Valentine's Day with a very special man. He's not Zapp Brannigan or anything!"
Bender, Who wants dolphin?
Bender," Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler."
Bender," Doc, I can't move my arms and legs. What's wrong with me?"
Farnsworth, And your skin still dangles so gracefully from your neck.
Leela, Really?
Zoidberg," We finished un-pinking the ship, Hubert. Now what?"
Bender, No sweat. We'll just take a spin on the B-train!
Bender," Well, step one, I had to lift the seat. That was the first little annoyance. Am I right, men?"
Zoidberg, Or will we?
Bender," Goodbye, moderation!"
Hermes," You're right, crabby. He's a hell of a lot funnier than you could ever be."
Bender," No, baby, never!"
Zoidberg, So long. I'm off to toss this old shell in the dumpster and maybe pick up those potato chips Amy didn't finish yesterday.
Leela," Okay. One, two..."
Bender," Hello, losers!"
Leela, Not this way.
Leela, It's a gigantic diamond! That thing must be worth a fortune.
Amy, I don't have a problem! I'm in a happy relationship that just happens to be robosex-
Bender," I'll miss you, Leela. I know you're just a carbon-based life form but I'll always think of you as a big pile of titanium."
Bender, You were in the best coma I've ever seen!
Bender, She is well-travelled. And I don't mean she travels a lot!
Leela, No!
Leela, You're my parents. All I've ever wanted is to know you. This is the happiest moment of my life.
Leela, It looks like ... a timeline of my whole life.
Leela," Actually ... they are! Confidentially, I might not make it back to my apartment tonight! Could you walk Nibbler for me?"
Hermes," Stamp it, file it. Oh, yeah! Send it overnight!"
Bender, Not inno-guilty-cent!
Hermes, You jerked the words right outta my mouth. We're their fathers and it's high times we acted like it.
Farnsworth," That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard, you imbecile!"
Bender, Both.
Fry," Too bad he wasn't an alligator. Y'know, when you flush those things, they stay alive in the sewers."
Farnsworth, Good heavens! Trilobots!
Leela," Come on, before it's too late!"
Farnsworth," Really? I didn't think anyone was interested. It all started 30-odd years ago. I was working in Mom's laboratories for the third time after twice before realizing how evil she was and vowing never to work for her again. But somehow the rich, wrong stench of her boney charms kept calling me back."
Leela, Fry? I missed you. Did you find out what you needed to find out?
Leela, No! No! It's tasted human blood!
Fry," No, that's not true!"
Fry, Go ahead. I deserve it. I wish those stupid racoons had never brought me to the future.
Zoidberg," I'll not only help you find it, I'll help you do more to it!"
Fry, Professy's back! Ew! You smell like smoking! And drinking.
Farnsworth," Well, there's time for one last question. Let's turn to the ""Who Ask"" machine to see who's next."
Farnsworth," Okay, but watch out for my new grill."
Amy, To think I put on an unflattering cupcake costume for you!
Bender, I'm just asking cause they look kind of secret.
Hermes, Nooo!
Zoidberg," Alright, alright, spare me your life story. Now what seems to be the trouble?"
Leela," As a pitcher, I serve up plenty of bean balls. So I know good beans when I see them. Bean-Bay Beans  They're the beaniest!"
Fry," Just wake up. Please. Just wake up, Leela."
Fry, Everything else in here held up OK.
Leela," I'm so scared, Fry. I don't know what to do."
Farnsworth, It takes any object and makes two smaller copies!
Fry, Yeah!
Fry," Please. Give me a chance to be romantic on my own. I've got a baggy of massage oil, and I'm gonna give you my super back rub, just like a I used to give Amy when I was going out with her, and she always seemed-- Uh-oh!"
Leela," No, never. I don't think. Anyhow, there's a crazed murderer on the loose, possibly in the shadows or hanging from the ceiling. So just stay calm while I call Fry."
Fry," Listen, Morgan, we're through. You're an evil, heartless woman and I never wanna see you again. However, would you help us get Bender back for old time's sake?"
Bender, Or a great big...
Farnsworth," Searing, searing pain that feels as if it were in a vice."
Fry," Really? What do you do, Bender?"
Bender, I was just tryin' to help.
Fry, You mean we can never catch up to him? Not even if we rub the engine with cheetah blood?
Amy, And huge.
Bender," Hold on, mac!  It ain't like that!"
Leela, But people already interfered. That planet was mined completely hollow.
Farnsworth," That's why I've made you my sole heir. The day I die, you'll be a very wealthy woman. Oh, my, yes. Incredibly wealthy. The day I die. Because you're so unimpulsive."
Bender," If you're an emperor, why don't you shut up? Move it, Fry."
Fry," Thanks, Bender!"
Bender," Yo, ABBA, what's that next door?"
Bender," Behold, my hand crafted purity. The modern world can bite my splintery, wooden ass!"
Amy," We are just the people this mind-switcher was made for by us! Wait, can I still change my mind?"
Fry, So this is where they stick old people. It's horrific!
Fry," Hey, Bender. Hey, Bender. Hey, Bender. Hey, Bender."
Fry, No.
Hermes," Get a job, you lazy kids!"
Leela, They're probably waiting for Joss Whedon.
Fry," Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Although, actually, it was sort of obvious."
Fry," Ah, this seems like a good place to take a dump. Leela? You're alive!"
Leela," And by ""people"" I mean you!"
Amy," Hey, it's Leela."
Bender, Dying sucks butt! How do you living beings cope with mortality?
Fry, It's OK. I had another guy!
Hermes," Oh, you're good kids. If I could feel anything right now, it would be pride. I was wrong! I can still feel pain!"
Farnsworth," Now look here, Wernstrom. You're making it sound as if the sphere was your idea when we both know... It was! All credit to my colleague, Ogden Wernstrom!"
Zoidberg," And he talked non-stop. Like a parrot of the sea, he was!"
Leela," Uh, e-e-excuse me.  I have to...someplace."
Amy, Is that your camouflage reflex or are you just happy to see me?
Farnsworth," And therefore, by process of elimination, the electron must taste like grapeade."
Fry," Yes I did, Leels. And I'll tell you why. Because it grows the brand."
Farnsworth, But-But what about my hopes and my dreams and my wonderful inventions?
Bender," If you hate intolerance and begin punched in the face by me, please support Proposition Infinity!"
Bender," Ah, leave him alone, Leela. So he's going a little wacko with his money. It's OK."
Fry," Well, now what? You guys wanna talk?"
Bender, Great to be here.
Fry," We're gonna die! It's every man for himself! Help me, Leela! You did it! We're safe!"
Leela, OK. I was just at this part  Yah!
Leela," While we were huddled in fear, Lars popped the question!"
Zoidberg," That's it over there. Don't worry, I managed to keep your head alive with some quick surgery."
Bender, No! Don't do it!
Fry," Wow, Bender. Are you and the ship an item? I mean I know you're both items but-- How can you date a ship anyway? It'd be like me dating a really fat lady. And living inside her. And she'd be all like--"
Farnsworth," That story was preposterous. Stephen Hawking in a pizzeria! This thing isn't worth the gold it's made of. Anyway, the fing-longer seems to be arousing success."
Bender," Come on in, I'll give you the tour!"
Zoidberg,"  Squirm all you want, you nasty dumpling. One less species for the universe, one more breakfast for..."
Farnsworth, Can anyone drive stick?
Fry, I guess so.
Fry, You have my fan script?
Leela, Us? Me? You? Kids?
Leela," Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times heavier than a boot."
Fry, Ooh! My popcorn's done!
Bender, Okey-dokey!
Fry," So we got her, huh? Bring her in!"
Leela, Ugh!
Hermes, You wanna see a picture of my boy?
Bender, Girls-of-Planet-Express calendar!
Bender," Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. Sheesh! Hey! What the-- Get away! Come on! I just got all the gum off of there! Hey! Hey! I hate you! I hate you all!"
Fry, And me.
Bender," I said scram, grapey!"
Bender," Keep 'em to yourself, Pops!"
Amy," So, Bender, how was the party?"
Bender," You were only frozen for two days. Uh, by the way, I broke your bed."
Fry, Leela! Bender! I missed you so much!
Hermes, I'll see you during the recess!
Fry," No, I need to get her a gift. And I need it before sundown."
Fry, Shut up!
Leela," Even if I had a pen, I couldn't write under these conditions. I'm going to some other planet, where I can concentrate."
Amy," Yeah. Y'know, Fry, I really like hanging out with you."
Fry," Bender, stop destroying heaven."
Fry, I fell through the ice! Cut me some slack!
Fry, You are? Did you grow a moustache since last night?
Fry," I'll just start you off with some bread. Some sexy, arousing bread!"
Leela, Say again. You're breaking up!
Farnsworth, Now that's a limbo-er's body!
Amy, Hi.
Hermes," Sorry, I spent all day putting my office in order. Now I got to go home and relax the traditional Jamaican way  A glass of warm milk and good night sleep."
Bender," I'm a bender. I bend girders, that's all I'm programmed to do."
Hermes, And for Bender-- Uh-oh! A black-bordered envelope.
Bender, Hey! Do I preach to you when you're lying stoned in the gutter? No! So beat it!
Bender, Sanctifying it! There! That ought to convert a few tailgaters.
Fry," Wait. I know where we can get beeswax. From those giant space bees that nearly killed us, and we swore we'd never go back there."
Farnsworth," And you, lad, all you need is brain."
Leela," What's wrong, Fry? Are you regretting another wasted year?"
Farnsworth," Oh, my! I haven't picked a new captain yet. It's always so hard to choose."
Farnsworth, You will be responsible for ensuring that the cargo reaches its destination.
Hermes, Ooh! It's been a while. This one is for that little kid who's limbo-ing up in heaven right now.
Farnsworth," You've been taking space honey? Be careful, you purple-haired imbecile!"
Bender, Huh?
Amy, It is across town.
Fry," What? Don't ever, ever say or think that again! Please! Just concentrate on staying alive. Fire! Look out! Oh! You almost got neutered."
Leela, No! Earth is gone!  We're the only two humans left in the universe!
Amy," God, what a wuss. Stop being such a spineless jellyfish."
Farnsworth," Ohh, twaddle-squat. There's no scientific consensus that life is important."
Leela, Crud nuggets! We de-spaced right next to the Nimbus.
Farnsworth, Activate stealth shielding.
Fry, And there's Hookerbot 5000. She's got a heart of solid gold!
Leela, This is officer 1B-DI requesting back-up.
Leela," Hold it, Santa! Consider this  You are programmed to destroy the naughty, but many of those you destroy are in fact nice. I submit to you that you are naughty and, logically, you must destroy yourself."
Farnsworth," Well, Omicron Persei 8 is about a thousand light years away. So the electro-magnetic waves would just recently have gotten there. You see--"
Leela, Exactly! He was a machine designed to hit blerns! I mean come on! Wireless Joe was nothing but a programmable bat on wheels.
Bender, Is it within city limits?
Zoidberg, Things used to be funny around here! Noses were picked. Pants fell down. So what changed? Only Fry could say... And he's gone!
Leela, It varies from person to person.
Fry, I guess it's for the best. The only machine I'll ever miss is... Bender.
Leela, Dwight and Cubert made us a better offer. We're paperboys now.
Fry," Trust me, I want twits that tittle."
Hermes," Sweet topology of cosmology, it's huge!"
Fry, In a minute. I just wanna finish this paperless work.
Fry," Alright, I'll take the 500 lizards. No, wait, yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes! The parrot!"
Fry," Hey, I've got one last thought."
Zoidberg, Ditto!
Fry, But the course isn't finished. And there's no girls allowed.
Amy," Oh, so this is where you shop for your boots?"
Leela, We did it! We won!
Leela," Oh, God! It's inhuman! It's like Hong Kong! I'll do it!"
Fry, Is he genetically engineered?
Leela," Who's ready to fight for equality? The Devolution Revolution has begun! Beautiful mutants, please welcome Devo!"
Zoidberg," Sorry, I'm set for life after that last job."
Bender," Leela, meet your future husband Sal."
Fry, Whatever. The correct answer is  To be a superhero. We have superpowers and we're Americans. This is our chance.
Farnsworth, It means you'll never be able to return to the surface.
Farnsworth," Ah, there we are. One gravity pump. Powerful enough to move the stars themselves. Now to begin the arduous task of attaching it to the ship so th--"
Amy, But I'm presenting my thesis tomorrow and I've barely had time to prepare.
Bender, Count me in! I'm gonna drink till I reboot!
Fry," So I'm really back? That's exactly what I wanted, I guess. Who are you?"
Leela, Take your hands off me! You've been assigned the job you're best at just like everyone else.
Fry," Jeez, Hermes, you seem awfully calm about this."
Bender," Hey, Fry, we've still got our costumes on. Wanna steal some more stuff?"
Fry," Man, that's dog's gonna be hard to beat. Look at him bring in the sheep! One sheep, two sheep ... ... three sheep."
Leela, That was terrible! People won't even know what we do.
Bender," Honestly, I couldn't think o' one good reason. But some decisions can't be made by thinking. Even if you're drunk! No galaxies there."
Fry, Huh?
Fry," Oh, right."
Bender," Eh, the Professor's was better."
Leela, They said I probably shouldn't fly with just one eye.
Fry, Like watching Leno.
Bender," My chair's too hard. It's a real pain in the, uh, whattya call it? Lower back! Yeah, that whole region."
Bender, Wiggles?
Fry," Hey, wait a second. How did you deliver a million papers in one hour?"
Leela," Don't mess with me, you ice-crapping snow-honkies. I just got dumped."
Fry," Don't get upset, Leela.  She's nothing like you."
Fry, Take me to him.
Bender," Yeah, yeah! Big whoop! No one cares. I got Bender-related news. I'm in love and I'm taking all my friends out to celebrate."
Fry, Ooh ... I know this ... whatyya call it? Lite Brite!
Bender," Hey, Fender! Man, I haven't seen you since high school. You still workin' at Jack In The Box?"
Bender," Amy, I reckon sweet talk don't come natural to me, but of everyone I've ever dated, you are probably in the top ten."
Fry," Not only that, I now know exactly how to end my comic book. Let's watch."
Fry," Um, OK. Let's go bowling."
Fry, Why would a robot need to drink?
Hermes, I enjoy humour when no one gets hurt.
Bender, Pwned again.
Zoidberg," So, it's just as I suspected all along. The crime is unsolvable! A letter from Bender, my good friend. Dear Dr. Jerkberg, if you're reading this, I'm already dead. The person who killed me was ... was-- My God! It can't be! The murderer, it was--"
Hermes, That's no ordinary space whale! It's a four-dimensional space whale!
Leela," Yeah. I mean, how many planets can there be?"
Bender," Oh, man! He's never gonna make it over that next pebble! Wait, wait! Oh, my God! He made it!"
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone! I'm sending you on an extremely controversial mission."
Fry," C'mon, Leela, why won't you go out with me? We both know there's something there."
Leela, You go fight biggest brain of all.
Zoidberg, Hooray!
Fry, That's when we saved Earth from a giant asteroid of garbage.
Fry, I don't care. I'm staying. I've got everything I want right here.
Fry, Always respect the chain o' command ... captain.
Amy, Surprise!
Bender," Yeah, right. What's he gonna do, break my legs?"
Leela," You do not, you big fat liar. You don't know anyone. All you do is watch TV."
Fry, Holy camolie! A seven-leaf clover!
Amy," Well, I got it. Now what, Captain?"
Leela, Maybe they're right. Maybe Nibbler is dumb.
Leela," Oh, Lord."
Leela, We recycle everything. Robots are made from old beer cans.
Fry, Hey who's the rocker jockey?
Farnsworth, I was born in prison and I'll die in prison.
Fry," Bender, they had a backwards time machine."
Leela, Who said that? How do you know my real name?
Fry," Hey, my girlfriend had one of those. Actually it wasn't hers, it was her dad's. Actually she wasn't my girlfriend, she just lived next door and never closed her curtains."
Zoidberg," That's me, baby!"
Fry, Bender?!
Hermes," And last, but not least, the sweet flower of the office  Me. Hermes Conrad."
Zoidberg, What's that thing on your neck?
Zoidberg, Far out! That head gave me a total head trip!
Hermes, What's this under the chocolates?
Leela, We do not.  And you can't talk.
Leela," Y'know, let's just say it's heads."
Farnsworth," Yeah, cool."
Leela," So long, overly complicated Japanese toilet!"
Bender, Bite my shiny metal ass.
Bender," Hey, thanks, buddy!"
Bender," So, I can, uh, keep the cheque?"
Bender, I met the most dynamite ladybot.
Farnsworth, Of course it works! It's just not very long.
Leela, They give you a discount if you've been here before.
Farnsworth," Oh, it's just a log I found in a hole in the bottom of the sea. Now, to penetrate its deepest mysteries."
Farnsworth," Who likes good news? Everyone. Then good news, everyone! Our next delivery isn't to some dangerous, outer-space planet. It's to Earth!"
Amy," Oh, yeah."
Bender, (Gasps) TV's Calculon! (He coughs)
Fry, Not for long!
Leela," Did that snake say, ""Hello""?"
Leela, Snap out of it!
Amy, Yay! Bender!
Bender," Yes, I can."
Fry," Save us, Catman."
Fry," Hey, Bender, you seem perky today."
Bender," Hey, what's this fat ugly thing? A frog? A toad? Or your momma!"
Fry," Professor, when did you become so obsessed with voting?"
Fry, Seymour!
Leela," We're boned, Bender. It's a brick wall."
Farnsworth," What do you say, Johnny? It's on me."
Zoidberg," I can't see from down here, I can't."
Leela, I'm zeroing in on him. BENGAY ... mothballs ... ... letters to the editor. It's the Professor!
Hermes, I concur.
Farnsworth, Jeepers!
Fry, Whose blood?
Bender, Ta-da!
Bender," Don't you get it, old man? Thanks to Dr. Scissor Hands, I wet myself every time I laugh. It's not funny! Well... I guess it is kinda funny. Uh-oh."
Fry," No! It's under here somewhere. We just 'ave to bust our way down. Remember the code of the ice. Thin an' crispy, way too risky."
Farnsworth, Yes? I see.
Fry," Happy birthday, Leela. I got you a card, but I guess I kinda lost it."
Amy, Guhh! Stop patronizing us.
Hermes, All opposed? All abstaining?
Farnsworth," That's not Fry's jacket. Fry's jacket is red. That's your jacket. An off-the-rack, lime green affair."
Fry," Oh, thank God!"
Fry, Tangled-up Christmas lights! We can take shifts untangling them.
Leela," OK, OK. We're not gonna force you until I finish this sentence. Get him!"
Fry," I am not acting weird, Leela. Why is everyone talking at once?"
Hermes, We're getting pretty deep. Look! Mole coffins!
Fry, She's right.
Bender, Behold  The Internet!
Bender, That's what they said about being alive.
Zoidberg," Leela, I would be honoured."
Hermes," Everyone, this is Francis."
Fry, You have to wake up.
Fry," Well? How are they? Oh, they're great! They're like sex, except I'm having them!"
Leela, Fry! Don't help him mutilate himself.
Bender, You mean--
Hermes, You wouldn't dare!
Zoidberg," What are you talking about, Uncle? Everybody remembers Harold Zoid!"
Bender," No, I'm Bender. We met once, remember?"
Bender," Oh, man! Come on! Comin' through!"
Bender," Hey, looks like Zoidberg's finally coming out of his shell. Get it? He's coming out--"
Leela, So what happened? How did Mom capture all you Nibblonians?
Fry," Really? No, that's not necessary."
Bender," Your Honour, I move for a mistrial on grounds of double jeopardy. Cubert Farnsworth cannot be tried twice for the same crime! Cubert is the Professor's clone. Ergo, they are legally the same person. Since you dismissed the charges against Cubert, you cannot convict the Professor of these same charges!"
Zoidberg, The captain's table! What an honour!
Fry, Earth is just the way it was before the white man came!
Fry," A really hot line segment. So, listen, sweetie pie, I was thinking maybe we should take this to the next step."
Bender, Old New York  The city that inspired a casino in Las Vegas.
Bender," I passed out around midnight, which is much earlier that usual, and when I woke up I found these in my chest cabinet."
Farnsworth, A flaming burp.
Bender," Honey, that thing was ruined the minute it went on you. That's what I'm talkin' 'bout."
Fry," Not this time. No matter what happens, I'll swear I be there."
Fry, No. Burn!
Leela," It's the 20th century, Professor."
Bender, That twizzler!
Bender, Everybody was doing it. I just wanted to be popular.
Fry," Beholdeth, Titanius, I cast a freeze ray upon you."
Farnsworth, You're porkin' at 'im!
Zoidberg," Not you, though! You'll make a complete recovery and go on to marry a super model! Funny plague, hypermalaria. It can kill immediately. Or lie dormant for decades. But, sooner or later, it erupts, causing fever, spasms, madness, coma, and finally... Death."
Bender, That was fun.
Leela, What are you doing here?
Fry," Hey, wait a second! I know where you can get some 20th-century cold virus without killing me!"
Zoidberg, The female Leela's problem is purely medical. Soon she will drop her eggs and they will hatch and all will be well.
Bender, So should we get our stuff and head down to the planet?
Amy," Here, Professor, I got you a programme."
Hermes, Okay. What you got?
Amy," So while they're towin' us, you wanna do it?"
Leela," Thanks for saving me from that creep, Fry."
Farnsworth," Merry Xmas, everyone!"
Fry," Melllvar, you can't let a TV show be your whole life. You can do anything you want. Look at Walter Koenig  After Star Trek, he became an actor."
Leela, An idea?
Fry," You gotta tell me  You're not actually attracted to Calculon, right? And if you are, don't tell me. Are you?"
Fry," I could make you happy too, if only you'd give me a chance."
Farnsworth, To avoid the tollbooth.
Fry, Yeah. But now it's the distant future. Why aren't we out doing everything I ever dreamed of?
Farnsworth, Yes!
Bender," ""Let's send a robot to explore it. 'Cause you can always buy another one for 20 bucks."""
Leela, Royal jelly. They feed it to the queen.
Farnsworth, I'll ruin you like I ruined this company.
Fry, What? What is it?
Farnsworth, There. This time I'm sure I've fixed the mind-switcher.
Hermes," And what about these funky table legs? It's like their part of some other, funkier painting."
Fry, Of course not. I love the future.
Bender, I promise nothing!
Bender, See you at the fight.
Amy, Dogs! The boning continues.
Amy, Are you sure?
Bender, Because the loser of our bet has to do a double somersault into a tub of alien goat vomit.
Fry, Third date!
Zoidberg, Eck!
Fry," Oh, mighty mayor. We're here about Turanga Leela."
Amy, Yes! Yes!
Fry," No, we're not. And as vice chairman, I believe I speak for the entire board when I issue this challenge to Mom. Look at my butt!"
Amy, Oh no! Is it possible to get everyone back to normal using four or more bodies?
Fry," I tell you, being here really takes me back to my college days."
Bender, Ew!
Leela," Aw, I know how you feel, Fry. There are times when I also feel like you need to go away."
Leela," I'm sorry you saw that, Fry. I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness."
Fry," No! Not McZongo! If anyone's gonna kill Mr. Peppy, it should be me."
Zoidberg," Bender, if you want to sleep in the tent tonight, you're welcome to join me and Hermes for a little ""just friends"" spooning."
Farnsworth," Oh, my, yes. Thank you all for saving me. Especially you, my little clone. No matter what you decide to do with your life, I'm still proud of you."
Fry, Alrighty!
Fry," Affirmative. I feel nothing. I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep ..."
Bender," The bylaws specifically state that no human may set foot in the League of Robots! If he has a human part, he's part human!"
Bender, Look! A single mother! Let's get her!
Leela," Now, unfortunately, the media is going to put a negative spin on this, like when we killed that guy, so to win public support, we'll need a lovable mascot."
Fry," Yeah, well, if you're sorry why are you doing it?"
Amy, Sunburn! My fabulous body! It's ruined! What happened to my parasol?
Zoidberg, Hooray!
Leela, No. Only what we need. Stuff the ship!
Bender," Oh, we're trapped!"
Farnsworth," Pazuzu? Oh, Pazuzu?"
Bender, You can get off me anytime.
Bender," With a twist-off top,"
Zoidberg," Amy, this is for you. A set of combs for your beautiful hair."
Leela," Maybe, if I move the compass like this, it will somehow kill the whale."
Farnsworth," Crew, you remember Cubert? Wonderful! Then I'm sure you won't mind being their legal guardians for a month!"
Leela," Okay, time to defuse this star cracker once and for all."
Leela," Zoidberg, I'm trying to—"
Hermes," It's a meanin'less title, but it helps insecure people feel better about themselves."
Leela," Uh, Professor, can we discuss this somewhere else?"
Farnsworth," Actually, through the miracle of science, that can be arranged."
Bender," Listen up, disco dummies, you just flunked outta Bender's College for Party Knowledge!"
Farnsworth, You'll be making a delivery to the planet Trisol...
Farnsworth," Fry, you dope! You've really screwed the granny this time! History needed that second lantern!"
Leela, All the whole numbers have been retired.
Bender," Well, it's 30 bucks, and there's a $10-mail-in rebate. When the League of Robots hears about this, they won't be pleased. Oh, you'll pay, my darlings."
Fry, Bender's great--
Farnsworth, Got it!
Bender, Boiled? Interesting.
Bender," C'mon, Fry, I really wanna see it. You know how I yearn for a simpler time. A time of barn dances and buggy rides, before life was cheapened by heartless hi-tech machines."
Fry," Well, buddy, how d'ya like your new home? See? He's happy already."
Hermes," You didn't even refrigerate it, you spineless lobster!"
Bender, W-W-Wait! What happened to your enthusiasm for stabbing them?
Amy," Oh, relax, it's fine. It looks lived in."
Farnsworth, Scammed? Me!? Sweetheart?!? Ohh!
Hermes, Look at me! I'm invisible!
Farnsworth, That's just it! You can't. You were built without a backup unit.
Amy," I am Amy. Leela and I used the Professor's mind-switching machine. [She puts ketchup on her ""creation""."
Fry, Flying bananas? Ha ha! I will slice them on my morning fish porridge.
Bender," Fellas, please. I'm in love!"
Bender," But sweet girls aren't for you, eh? You hard-fighting, hard-farting, ugly, ugly son of a--"
Fry," This is hard. Yivo, you know how sometimes things break up? Well..."
Farnsworth," Hmm. I'm not quite sure. Perhaps seeing things from a new perspective has reminded me of life's beauty. Or perhaps my new posture is causing blood to pool in the back of my brain, resulting in a mild delirium. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose."
Fry, Say it in Russian!
Fry, I could've flip-flopped out.
Amy," The ratchet won't turn backwards, but what if we kept pushing it forward? Earth would start turning again."
Leela, You do?
Leela, So my humiliation is over?
Fry," Well, you know how I feel.  I waited for you for a thousand years.  I can wait a little longer."
Fry," Oh, now I understand."
Amy, Beg pardon?
Hermes, The flight had a stopover on the Brain Slug Planet. Hermes liked it so much he decided to stay of his own free will.
Amy, I'm even richer!
Hermes," Dating you ex, Fry? Have you lost all self-respect?"
Leela, Since when do you care about us?
Bender," But, if we don't perform, in what sense do we have an act?"
Fry, Aww. Poor little guy. Let me just take a look at-- Aha! I won! I'm the new chief! I'm the tallest and I weigh the most!
Farnsworth," Great delivery, everyone. You're the finest crew I've had the honour to work with. Oh, my. We're being foreclosed upon. You're all terrible and incompetent!"
Bender," No, we're not, you little bed-wetter. Oops! I'm sorry."
Bender," Sorry, buddy. I too know what it's like to have a dream I'll never achieve."
Bender," No! Yes! I don't know! Why? Why did he do this to me? All I wanted was a little quality control. But he didn't care enough. And now I gonna die. I deserve better! I'm Bender, damn it! I'm Bender!"
Fry," I know you've rejected me a lot before but, frankly, I wasn't sure we were right for each other either. But now I am. So how 'bout a date tonight?"
Bender," But we still have one hope, my big televised debate! I'm our A in the hole!"
Hermes, That's why Bender will have to make the actual delivery.
Fry, There's no bus to Jersey City.
Fry, It's clovering time!
Fry, I thought your duty was to cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate.
Leela, We're entering the Omega system.
Bender, Hambone! Hambone! Hambone.
Bender, Permanent? That's completely out of character for Antonio. I'm gettin' up.
Farnsworth, I can't quite read the sign. Pazuzu? Pazuzu?
Fry, Bonder? Is it really you?
Zoidberg, Aw! So close.
Amy," Hi, Dad. It's me and my co-workers."
Farnsworth, The very instant I became old.
Hermes," People, we got a problem  Little Nibbler's been coughing up hairballs."
Farnsworth," Funny, I could use a little extra meat on my bones. Wait a second, if we switch bodies, I could live life to the extreme, and you could indulge your demonic food lust."
Leela," Oh, Lord! Teeth do not belong in your pants, Professor."
Leela," Come on, skipper. It's my last chance to prove I'm not the worst player ever. Please put me in."
Leela, Glad you could make it.
Fry, I'm the star of the show.
Fry, Close.
Hermes, We're jerked! Nothing can stop a monster that big.
Fry, Delivery boy? No! Not again! Please! Anything else!
Amy," All I wanted was to gorge myself a little, but I can't digest anything with these false teeth and this hit-or-miss colon."
Bender," Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it ""sorry""? No. ""Fun-derful""? Uh, ""non-alcoholic""?"
Farnsworth, It appears that the very fabric of space-time has ripped.
Farnsworth," It's similar to the United Nations from your time, Fry."
Leela, I will now make my closing statement. With my fiancé deceased ... ... I hereby return to my single female lawyer career. No matter what any man says.
Leela," And though you're cold and sore and ugly, Your pride will mask the pain."
Hermes, Jamaicans have other interests. Which is why the limbo team got detained at the airport.
Leela, We'll need help getting in. Any volunteers?
Fry, I agree.
Farnsworth," Just a second, just a second."
Zoidberg," You know, Fry, I've got a little place just outside town. You could come visit, maybe?"
Leela, Mutants!
Farnsworth," Oh, gentlemen. When that sun rises in the morning, we're toast. These are our last moments together. So, if anyone's got any good fart jokes, now would be the time."
Zoidberg, We'll split an order.
Hermes, Great Bonda of Uganda! We can vote against it!
Fry," Aw, I gotta chipmunk."
Leela," Oh, yeah? Well... Shut up."
Leela, We are on line.
Farnsworth," Good news, everyone. We've got a very special delivery today."
Zoidberg," There, little friend. Good as new."
Leela, I know we're ladies-in-waiting but what are we waiting for?
Hermes," Well, it's six o'clock. I guess we'll have to deliver that Human heart tomorrow. Good work, people!"
Fry," Psst! Leela. I've set up a time-proof shelter in the closet. There's only room for two, and you're the one I wanna share it with."
Farnsworth," Please, stop bickering. I arranged that you be roommates for a reason  So I'd only have to remember one phone number. Now shake hands and make up."
Zoidberg, Go on.
Fry, What just happened?
Bender,"   I'm in trouble. they found out I work with humans and - oh no, oh no!"
Fry," Well, you got anything else for him?"
Leela," Thanks, Fry. You're a good friend."
Fry," Leela, there's something I've wanted to tell you for a long time but every time I try I get nervous and my mouth feels like it's stuffed with peanut butter, even when it's not."
Fry, I know him. Leo Wong. I work with his daughter.
Leela," No. And it's pronounced ""sham-pane""."
Leela, Stop!
Fry," You haven't won yet, Mervin! You didn't expect us to even go to a museum, much less steal this ancient heat-seeking missile."
Leela," Fry, shut up."
Bender," I can't afford a carriage,"
Bender, There! This'll teach those filthy bastards who's lovable. Now all I have to do is spell check it and it's ready for my admiring public. No! Get away from there! That's it.
Bender," No, we did it. Ladies and gentlemen, if together we were able to defeat this giant space monster, think how also we might defeat the monsters of poverty and disease and unliteracy. In this spirit, I ask my fellow Benders to join me in working diligently to—"
Leela, This is our chance to teach Mom a lesson. Let's take the anti-crystal and shove it up Mom's regular crystal.
Fry," Hey, where's Bender?"
Zoidberg, I came as soon as I could. It appears to be a case of African hydraulic fever!
Bender," I mean, with time, my funk level could--"
Bender, Says who?! I didn't witness anything!
Farnsworth," I couldn't live with myself, Leela. I call myself a scientist, wear the white coat and probe a monkey every now and again, yet I put monetary gain ahead of preserving nature. Can you ever forgive me?"
Bender," Oh, yeah? Well bite my shiny metal-- Oh, nooo!"
Farnsworth, Dirt doesn't need luck.
Fry, Fahrenheit or Celsius?
Leela, Wait. I didn't agree to...
Hermes, I don't want you to worry about your jobs while you're away. That's why I'm firing you now.
Farnsworth," Objection, I'm not crazy! I created you all and I came here in a homemade spaceship and lived in a cave. If you don't believe me, ask my uncle."
Fry," Yuck, but yay!"
Fry," Hey, I have an idea. Let's do that!"
Leela," Nice job, Francis! I liked how you didn't get drunk and steal anyone's organs. Like our old Robot—"
Leela," Thank you, Mayor Poopenmeyer."
Fry," Well, what do you suggest? A daring daylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant-back? That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!"
Amy," Dad, gleesh! I'm attracted to Bender, not his emotionless wine bucket!"
Bender," Howdy, doodies. What's new?"
Farnsworth, Their wha?!
Fry," So, what can I get you this evening?"
Farnsworth, What?
Fry," Sure, I just like TV better."
Fry," Listen, Doc, if you wanna score you gotta fake like you're in love. Just look her in the eye, start crying and say ""I've never been so happy."""
Fry," Hey, who's this guy?"
Leela," Let's go. If I say one more thing, I might say it with my evening boot."
Fry," But I wouldn't even know what to write about. Unless... OK, I'll do it. If I can make it about Leela."
Amy, We ran out of fuel on Mercury and one thing led to another.
Bender," Now, which group of heads is good enough for me to hang out with? What do you think, Fry? Fry?"
Leela, Then why didn't you give me any?
Hermes," Wait, why am I screaming? It got me, too!"
Amy," Awww, don't blame yourself, Bender."
Farnsworth, I suppose. Hello?
Leela, Ain't got that.
Bender," Hey, look! An ugly scared guy! Boo!"
Fry, No! I'm gonna infect my guinea pig with the common cold and launch it into space to see if it gets cured by cosmic rays!
Farnsworth," Certainly not! Not until I demonstrate this new microscope lens, made from the debris of that diamondium comet."
Bender, Hey. What I don't do is none of your business.
Zoidberg, Jesus Christ! ...and his Twelve Apostles!
Amy," Oh, wow! It's totally retro!"
Fry," That's why we can't let her see this.  Leela, lock the doors so Leela doesn't—EEEEE!"
Hermes," Look, fantastical golden escalators."
Farnsworth, Pazuzu!
Fry," Who asked you to? I told you a hundred times to stop treating me like a baby. Now go. Go gather your nuts, you nagging grasshopper."
Leela," I'm sorry we suspected you, Flexo. It's just, what with the beard and all--"
Bender, Because there is! Hit it!
Bender," I didn't steal 'em, I bought 'em. I love her that much."
Leela, Move it!  I gotta get home and do laundry!
Zoidberg, What are we going to do there?
Fry, Because... Because...
Zoidberg, Hooray! I'm useful! I'm having a wonderful time!
Bender, Sounds like fun on the bun.
Bender," Remember your manners, kids. Forks go in the left pocket, spoons in the right."
Bender, I ain't no stinkin' steam engine! Chicken's ready.
Hermes, That Guy is nothing but a flashy con man! And you've been hypnotised by his swinging baloney!
Zoidberg," I just meant without our good friends Fry, Leela, Amy and the robut."
Farnsworth," Mr. Blob, our sons have come to apologise for damaging your window. They've learned their lesson and they want to make amends."
Fry, Because I don't like being used.
Leela, No! We don't need a war of the worlds.
Bender, Yahoo! The system fails again!
Bender," My what, now?"
Leela, We won't even have to leave New New York! The package is going to Long Long Island.
Hermes, Incredible! Zoidberg had friends?!
Farnsworth," Oh, fuff! He's not causing any trouble. Now, if you don't mind, I'm rather busy. I seem to have mislaid my alien mummy. This sarcophagus should contain the remains of Emperor Nimballa, who ruled Zuban 5 over 29 million years ago."
Zoidberg, Ow!
Fry," Hey, look! The players who broke the various colour barriers."
Zoidberg, It was a different time.
Farnsworth, Teddy Bear Junction  The worst scum-hole in the galaxy.
Bender," Ooh! Microbrewed! My guys did alright! I think I'll make my countenance to shine down upon them. Malachi, good work. There's no slowing down with the Metal Lord tonight."
Fry," You might as well put that chequebook away, because I've discovered something even more important  My friends. And they aren't worth even a penny to me. That's why these anchovies are going on a pizza, so I can share the food I love with the people I like."
Fry," Aw, you guys came to watch me make out! That is so sweet. Wait a minute! Is that the head of who I think it's of?"
Bender," I love you, buddy!"
Zoidberg, No.
Amy, OK ... all set!
Bender," No, you gave me a fifty."
Bender," Fry! Hermes! Where my humans are? Ah, who cares? It is on."
Zoidberg," Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in a high-speed centrifuge, separating out the denser fluid of His Highness."
Hermes, Everyone else is off the ship. Where in Babylon is Bender?
Bender," Oh I get it, make the robot do all the work!"
Bender, Thank you.
Hermes, Give us back our genitals!
Fry," It must be possible. It's happening. By the way, what's happening?"
Leela, Look how high the asteroid belt is pulled up on that planet.
Leela, Fry! Fry!
Fry," Of course, don't you trust me?"
Fry, You wanna try escaping again?
Fry," Wait, wait, wait. What really killed the dinosaurs?"
Fry, Pst! We found him!
Fry," Yeah, he was my neighbour. Why?"
Bender," I hope it was one of my enemies; those guys suck! Oh, no! My uncle Vladimir."
Leela," It's crunch time. Let's do this. It's for you, Professor."
Zoidberg, Sure. Me.
Leela," One thing about Bristol-Myers Squibb, they know how to cook a steak."
Farnsworth," They're all infected, just like the bees on Earth."
Zoidberg, They got medals.
Leela, Is it part of the opera?
Zoidberg, You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from internal parasites?
Fry, What?
Farnsworth, Fry is right.
Leela, What is it?
Leela, You buy one pound of underwear and you're on their list forever.
Bender, Not even if they're sautéed in a little mud?
Bender," Oops. I'm so, so sorry, Leela. I just wanted to annoy you."
Leela," Alright, but I wanna lick the beaters."
Fry," Bender, no!"
Leela, I must've left them onboard.
Fry," Uh, maybe we should stick with people we know and trust. I mean, Flexo's great, but--"
Leela," You did it, Fry."
Zoidberg," Wait, not dead.  The other thing."
Fry," Your golf club sure is classy, Mr. Wong. Naked statue classy."
Bender," Look, brah, you just not gonna find a whole lot of hot, gigantic Omicronian babes in this solar system."
Bender," You're right, I need professional help. And damn the expense."
Farnsworth, No! I was about to close the deal.
Farnsworth, I was out on the widow's walk keeping a hopeless vigil for the return of my first delivery crew. It's been fifty years since they disappeared.
Fry," Are you okay, Leela?"
Bender, High school gym renovations on schedule? What a load!
Bender, Uh ... where?
Hermes," Fry's over there, man."
Fry," Yeah, that."
Farnsworth, Ta-da! It's a glow-in-the-dark nose you can wear over your regular non-glowing nose. Observe.
Leela, I hope he'll be OK in there with all those big animals.
Zoidberg, Yay!
Amy, What?
Leela," Stop bothering me, Fry, I need full concentration."
Bender, Who built you?
Farnsworth," Oh, God! My tract!"
Amy, What?
Leela," Oh, no! It's heading right for those two nerds!"
Bender, But?
Leela," Yes, Sally?"
Bender, Your momma's so ugly!
Leela, So this language cartridge will let you distract them.
Fry," When I'm with you, every day seems like double-soup Tuesday."
Zoidberg, Play that thing!
Farnsworth, Good Lord! A second ball of garbage! That just might work!
Hermes, Ooh!
Amy," Good morning, Bender."
Bender," Ah, this thing stinks."
Fry," You OK there in the embassy, Zoidberg?"
Fry," Uh, could I have some Slurm, please?"
Fry, Over there! Look! It's the moon landing site! We found it!
Fry, Think of the unborn embryo!
Fry," Yup, I kissed his ass from cheek to shining cheek. So, what do I do next?"
Fry," Well, that's that, then.  We're back, everyone!"
Fry," Yeah, but he might get kind of upset. I don't think I can do that to him."
Leela, Bender?
Fry, You are? So things aren't working out with whatshisname?
Leela, Animals?
Fry, Why does everyone keep saying that?
Farnsworth," There is no target consumer! Only targets. Targets that will tremble in fear as their new master hands down edicts in my glorious, booming voice! Now quit pestering me, you scoundrels!"
Leela, Thanks.
Amy, Uh ... that's me.
Farnsworth," No, that was air escaping from the folds of his fat. Goodnight, sweet prince. You were the greatest man any of us will ever know. Well, let's get him out of here. He's starting to smell up the joint."
Fry, Chug! Chug!
Amy, It didn't work you doddering old
Leela, Eurgh! Who the hell are you?
Fry," That doesn't look like an ""L"" at all. Unless you count lowercase."
Bender, Wake up!
Leela, I can't just stand by and be silent about Bender anymore.
Bender," Goodbye, Professor. Before I leave, I just want you to know I've never done any work whatsoever. Zoidberg, I know it seems like I can't stand you. Leela, you'll have to watch out for Fry now."
Amy," Leela, we're right here."
Fry, You are a calculator.
Fry, That's nice.
Fry," OK, go ahead."
Farnsworth," Well, crew, this is it. That cookie bouquet isn't going to deliver itself."
Bender, He's a madman! A madman!
Fry," Finally! Sweet justice! Sweet, juicy justice!"
Bender," Fry! Throw in the towel! For God's sakes, Fry!"
Leela, You know what else I could use? A weekend at one of those fancy spas. And a Toblerone.
Leela," It's ocean madness alright. Sailors call it aqua dementia, the deep-down crazies, the wet willies, the screaming moist!"
Bender, Woo! Wait. The Bermuda Tetrahedron?
Fry, What about me? Can I come back at severely-reduced pay?
Leela, It's so romantic.
Leela, How long have you been at it?
Bender, Neat. So where are we goin'?
Bender, No. He was eating some food I made and by a crazy coincidence his stomach exploded. Now I'm here to avenge him.
Fry," Leela, I don't know if words can describe how I feel about you—"
Bender," So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein, huh?"
Fry," Ew, she's Scottish!"
Fry," Well, tell her that. And then?"
Leela," Hold the phone. If that's Yancy, why does the inscription say Philip J. Fry?"
Fry," I don't need them. Not when I have my antique videos, my bucket of fossilised KFC and 50 million dollars worth of anchovies."
Fry, Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!
Leela, I was raised in an orphanarium. My parents are sewer mutants who I never even met until a few years ago.
Leela, The cyclops eater!
Farnsworth, Sir! The sphereoboom is not for sale.
Leela," Mom, he's a cockroach from outer space."
Fry," Yup, I remember. They came in last at the Olympics then retired to promote alcoholic beverages."
Leela, Look's like everybody's got somebody. Except me.
Amy, Yeah!
Bender, Are you crazy? That's Little Bender you're talking about. I can't cut it off. You're not a robot or a man so you wouldn't understand. I gotta get out of here.
Farnsworth, Because it didn't!
Fry," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Fry, Did anyone else feel aroused and jealous and worried?
Fry, Fry.
Bender, Robo-American Studies.
Bender," Maybe you don't understand just how rich he is. In fact, I think I'd better put on a monocle."
Zoidberg," Question  Do you have to have been cryogenically frozen to get the free-- You didn't let me finish. I was going to say ""to get the free food""."
Zoidberg, Welcome to my life!
Fry," Pfft! That's for losers. C'mon, sin your heart out."
Farnsworth," Oh, my, no. Off we go!"
Fry, Hello. I'd like to enrol in Police Academy.
Fry," Bender, this world isn't good enough for you."
Fry, Woo!
Leela, Fry!
Zoidberg, Aw.
Farnsworth, We sold enough of those calendars since yesterday!
Amy," It's so sad, where will I go? What will I do?"
Hermes, The long search is over.
Bender," Stop it, stop it! It's not right! You've crossed a line."
Leela," Well, that was disturbing."
Hermes," Actually, on a robot, they sorta do."
Farnsworth," Eh ... wha? Oh, oh, OK, I think there's one can left. Oh, my."
Fry, This is unbelievable! What do you heads do all day?
Hermes, You forget!
Bender, I was. But they let me go when I told them that I'd killed a million billion humans.
Bender, Strike!
Zoidberg," I'm a doctor, she's dead."
Leela, I'm getting them a special one-day surface permit from Citihall.
Bender," Yes, but I aim not at the dragon but at the river itself to create a shroud of steam through which we can escape."
Leela," Kif's dead, Bender."
Leela, What planet is this anyway?
Leela," Wait, I never meant for you to... Oh, no! Fry! Fry! No! No!"
Hermes, And I've got a hankerin' for a useless remedy created by a schoolteacher.
Amy, We only got two drops.
Leela, It's amazing. It's like a textbook on evolution.
Leela," Bender, you're cured! But what happened to Fry?"
Fry," Hey, I was frozen. I think I know what people wanna hear when they first wake up. Bathroom's that way."
Fry, Hey!
Fry, What's he do?
Leela," As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV."
Fry, He's alive!
Fry, So that's where babies' sweaters come from!
Fry," What's so far-fetched about mermaids? I mean, there's all sorts of weird sea creatures here in the future. Like Dr. Zoidberg."
Bender, Ow!
Bender, That's what I'm gonna call the yacht. Stop pickin' me! Whoa!
Bender," Wow, that lady's got a huge ass!"
Amy," Well, the statue's perfect now."
Bender," Merry Xmas, kids!"
Bender," Leela, that was great! Even I have to admire the performance of me, Bender!"
Leela, Pooh!
Leela," Everyone knows my secret, but no one cares.  I have nothing to hide anymore.  Oh, Fry, thanks to your selfish rudeness, a terrible weight has been lifted from my heart!"
Zoidberg," Oh, I don't know, Fry. I think I'm too poor to follow a band around in a van."
Leela," Uh, Commander? Could you tell me when the bomb is exploding?"
Bender, What'd ya got there? Numbers?
Amy," Oh, no! Someone you know must've died."
Farnsworth," Oh, I don't want to go to Neptune."
Fry, Try harder!
Bender," Great, we're gonna die."
Leela, Never!
Fry, Beth said that?
Bender," Oh, and bring my toboggan."
Zoidberg, But we're plotzing here!
Bender," Single Female Lawyer, Fighting for her client, Wearing sexy miniskirts,"
Fry, I'll show ye!
Amy, I wasted my youth porking out.
Fry," Look, I'm trying to save someone here. I'll have to come back for those later."
Leela, Hang on. Hang on. Jump! Hold on to your helmet!
Leela," Look, I'm not saying eating meat is wrong..."
Bender, Yeah.
Fry," Oh, no! Please! No! Perfect!"
Zoidberg, Aha!  That explains this growth on your drive shaft.
